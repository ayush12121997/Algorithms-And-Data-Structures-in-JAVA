<a name="Printing"></a>
## <p align="center"> String Builder Printing </p>
Certain questions which require multiple print statements one after the another, may result in a TLE just because of the printing delay. faster printing can be achieved through StringBuilder. Use StringBuilder to form a big string of input by constantly appending smaller outputs and then print the entire string once. Saves time.
```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.append("Printing content");
sb.append("Add a new line with backslash n \nlike this");
System.out.println(sb.toString());
```

### Basic Concepts
- Lookup : O(1)
- Update : O(1)
```java
ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>(); //Empty size
ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>(10); //10 size
arr.get(i); //Get value at index i in O(1)
arr.set(i, value); //Set value at index i in O(1)
arr.size(); //Get array size in O(1)
arr.add(value); //Add value at end of array in O(1)
arr.add(i, value); //Add value at index i in O(size - i)
```

<a name="Arrays_BubbleSort"></a>
### Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is based on the methodoly that we constantly check adjacent elements that whether or not they are in particular sorted order. And if found to be wrongly arranged, we swap their positions. It can be seen that this method if applied n times on an array of length n, will result in a sorted array. We only run the iterations till the point we get a sorted array. Hence, if the array is already sorted then the complexity is O(N) and if in worst case we do O(N) work N times hence O(N^2).

- Best Case : O(n)
- Average Case : O(n^2)
- Worst Case : O(n^2)
- Number of comparisons(Best case) : n-1
- Number of comparisons(Worst case) : (n-1)(n)/2
- Space complexity : O(1)
```java
public int[] BubbleSort(int[] a)
{
    int temp = 0;
    int n = a.length;
    // For n iterations
    for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
    {
        // Used to check whether we have reached the
        // sorted condition or not
        boolean flag = false;
        // Iterate entire list comparing adjacent elements
        for(int j = 1; j < n; j++)
        {
            if(a[j-1] > a[j])
            {
                temp = a[j-1];
                // Swap adjacent elements if wrongly arranged
                a[j-1] = a[j];
                a[j] = temp;
                flag = true;
            }
        }
        // Flag is false, if array already sorted
        if(!flag)
        {
            break;
        }
    }
    return a;
}
```

<a name="Arrays_SelectionSort"></a>
### Selection Sort
In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray. SO hecne in two loops, one outer one for every index, and inner for every index after the outer index, we find the smallest element and swap it with the element at outer index. See this for better understanding: https://www.w3resource.com/w3r_images/selection-short.png

- Best Case : O(n)
- Average Case : O(n^2)
- Worst Case : O(n^2)
- Number of comparisons(Best case) : (n-1)(n)/2
- Number of comparisons(Worst case) : (n-1)(n)/2
- Space complexity : O(1)
```java
public int[] SelectionSort(int[] a)
{
    int n = a.length;
    for(int i = 0; i < n- 1; i++)
    {
        int min_ind = i;
        int min = a[i];
        for(int j = i + 1; j < n; j++)
        {
            if(a[j] < min)
            {
                min = a[j];
                min_ind = j;
            }
        }
        int temp = a[min_ind];
        a[min_ind] = a[i];
        a[i] = temp;
    }
    return a;
}
```

<a name="Arrays_InsertionSort"></a>
### Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to selection sort. Here instead of selecting minimum form remaining array, for every element we place it at its correct position in the array so far. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part. Look at this for bettwe understanding: https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/insertionsort.png

- Best Case : O(n)
- Average Case : O(n^2)
- Worst Case : O(n^2)
- Number of comparisons(Best case) : (n-1)(n)/2
- Number of comparisons(Worst case) : (n-1)(n)/2
- Space complexity : O(1)
```java
public int[] InsertionSort(int[] arr)
{
    int n = arr.length;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    {
        int key = arr[i];
        int j = i - 1;
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key)
        {
            arr[j+1] = arr[j];
            j = j-1;
        }
        arr[j+1] = key;
    }
    return arr;
}
```

<a name="Arrays_MergeSort"></a>
### Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves until we have reached the point where the two divided arrays are each individully merged alreay and then merge the two sorted halves back together by backtracking the recursion stack. In simpler words, we keep splitting the array to the point where single elements are reached. We know that all single elements are individually sorted so we start merging these elements back together in a sorted manner. Refer to this for better visualiztion: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Merge-Sort-Tutorial.png

- Best Case : O(nlog(n))
- Average Case : O(nlog(n))
- Worst Case : O(nlog(n))
- Number of comparisons(Best case) : nlogn(n)
- Number of comparisons(Worst case) : nlogn(n)
- Space complexity : O(n)

// The main function that is called for mergeSort in an array
// Start = 0 and end = n-1 for entire array length
public void MergeSort(int[] arr, int start, int end)
{
    if(start>end)
    {
        // Find mid
        int mid = start + (end - start)/2;
        // Divide array into two halves and
        // recursively call mergesort on both
        MergeSort(arr, start, mid);
        MergeSort(arr, mid + 1, end);
        // Merge the two sorted arrays
        Merge(arr, start, mid, end);
    }
}

// Merge function for merging the arrays
public Merge(int[] arr, int start, int mid, int end)
{
    // Temp array the size of the total merged array
    int[] temp = new int[end - start + 1];
    // i marks the starting of first array
    int i = start;
    // mid+1 marks the starting of second array
    int j = mid + 1;

<a name="Arrays_PrefixSum"></a>
### Prefix Sum
Prefix sum is a method in which you calculate the sum of elements of an array upto a given index and store it in a different array. This process is done for all the indexes of the array.
```java
// Let input array be arr[] of size n

int[] prefixSum = new int[n];
prefixSum[0] = arr[0]; 
for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
{
    prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i-1] + arr[i];
}

// Now the prefix sum array has sum of elemnts of the array upto that index.
```
This method can be used in a variety of questions such as:
1. Range sum queries
2. Equilibrium index of an array
3. Range update queries

We will cover these problems later if needed.

### Tips and tricks for JAVA arrays
#### Direct sorting
```java
// For array list
Collections.sort(arrayListName);

// For array
Arrays.sort(arrayName);
```
#### Convert array to ArrayList and viceversa
```java
// ArrayList -> Array
arrayListName.toArray();

// Array to ArrayList
Arrays.asList(arrayName);

// ArrayList of ArrayList into 2d array
arrayListName.toArray(new int[size of outer parent array list][size of inner array lists]);
```
#### Comparator Sort
```java
// For arraylist
class myComparison implements Comparator<Object>
{
    @Override
    public int compare(Object a, Object b)
    {
        if(a.val > b.val)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        else if(a.val < b.val)
        {
            return -1;
        }
        else
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
Collections.sort(arrayListName, new myComparison());

// For array (2D arrays)
// Assume there is a 2D array of kind [[1,2], [2,3], [4,5], [5,6]]
// To sort this on the basis of first number of every inner []
Arrays.sort(arrayName, (i1, i2) -> Integers.compare(i1[0], i2[0]));

<a name="Arrays_BinarySearch"></a>
### Binary Search
Given a sorted array, we can find the existence of an element in O(logN) time instead of the standard O(N) time of a normal iterative search. 

- Best Case : O(1)
- Average Case : O(log(n))
- Worst Case : O(log(n))
- Space complexity : O(1)

Binary search can be used for the following purposes:
1. Index of a key
2. Index of first occurrence of a key
3. Index of last occurrence of a key
4. Index of least element greater than key
5. Index of greatest element less than key

#### Index of a key
As the array is sorted, we can in each iteration reduce our search space to half. We follow the following steps:
1. Directly look at the middle element. If the element is the element we are looking for it is the answer.
2. If it is bigger than the value we are looking for, so the element lies in the left subarray.
3. If it is smaller than the value we are looking for, so the element lies in the right subarray.
4. This process can be repeated recursively till the search space becomes 0 or we have found the element.
```java
// Recursive Binary Search
// The function remains the same, we just call it with modified
// starting and ending points
public int BinarySearch(int[] arr, int start, int end, int value)
{
    if (start > end)
    {
        return -1;
    }
    int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
    if (arr[mid] == value)
    {
        return mid;
    }
    else if (arr[mid] > value)
    {
        return BinarySearch(arr, start, mid - 1, value);
    }
    else
    {
        return BinarySearch(arr, mid + 1, end, value);
    }
}

// Iterative Binary Search
// In the same function inside a while loop, we keep updating
// the starting and the ending points
public int BinarySearch(int[] arr, int value)
{
    int start = 0;
    int end = arr.length - 1;
    while(start <= end)
    {
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == value)
        {
            return mid;
        }
        else if (arr[mid] > value)
        {
            end = mid - 1;
        }
        else
        {
            start = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```
#### Index of first occurrence of a key:
If the list contains duplicates, we may wish to get the first time an element occurs in the sorted list.
The modification from the normal code for binary search is that even when we find an element we do not return it directly. Instead we search for it once again in the left subarray as if more elements with the same value existed before the element we have found, they would necessarily be to its left.
```java
public int BinarySearch(int[] arr, int value)
{
    int start = 0;
    int end = arr.length - 1;
    int ans = -1;
    while(start <= end)
    {
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == value)
        {
            ans = mid;
            end = mid -1;
        }
        else if (arr[mid] > value)
        {
            end = mid - 1;
        }
        else
        {
            start = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```
#### Index of last occurrence of a key
If the list contains duplicates, we may wish to get the last time an element occurs in the sorted list.
The modification from the normal code for binary search is that even when we find an element we do not return it directly. Instead we search for it once again in the right subarray as if more elements with the same value existed after the element we have found, they would necessarily be to its right.
```java
public int BinarySearch(int[] arr, int value)
{
    int start = 0;
    int end = arr.length - 1;
    int ans = -1;
    while(start <= end)
    {
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == value)
        {
            ans = mid;
            start = mid + 1;
        }
        else if (arr[mid] > value)
        {
            end = mid - 1;
        }
        else
        {
            start = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```
#### Index of least element greater than key
So far one thing must be cear that all we need to do in binary serch is just think of the three conditions where we have to make a decision. So when we need to find the smallest element just greater than a given key we have the following three condtions:
1. When the middle element is the key: We search in the array to the right for a value just greater than this.
2. When the middle element is greater than the key: We store this value as a plausible answer and then search on the left for a smaller vlue if it exists.
3. When the middle element is smaller than the key: We search in the array to the right.
```java
public int BinarySearch(int[] arr, int value)
{
    int start = 0;
    int end = arr.length - 1;
    int ans = -1;
    while(start <= end)
    {
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == value)
        {
            start = mid + 1;
        }
        else if (arr[mid] > value)
        {
            ans = mid;
            end = mid - 1;
        }
        else
        {
            start = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
```
#### Index of greatest element less than key
The idea is similar to finding least element greater than a key.
```java
public int BinarySearch(int[] arr, int value)
{
    int start = 0;
    int end = arr.length - 1;
    int ans = -1;
    while(start <= end)
    {
        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == value)
        {
            end = mid - 1;
        }
        else if (arr[mid] > value)
        {
            end = mid - 1;
        }
        else
        {
            ans = mid;
            start = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

<a name="Arrays_InPlace"></a>
### In place operations to store two values in single position
If the maximum element of an array is known, pick any number, say value, greater than this maximum element. Now in order to make in place swaps, without the use of a temp variable, just add ((arr[i] % value) * value) to the element, say at index j, where you want to put arr[i]. Note, it is not necessry to put arr[i] at the new index. Any element less than value can be added.
This works in all cases as:
- For move involving an unchanged index to an unchanged index:
    - As value > maximum element of the array, initially any arr[i] % value = arr[i].
    - Now at new index, say index j, arr[j] = arr[j] + (arr[i] * value).
    - If arr[j] is now divided by value, it would give us the answer arr[i] as arr[j]/value = 0 and (arr[i] * value) / value = arr[i].
- For a move involving a previously changed index to an unchanged index:
    - Let the number at a particular index i be, arr[i] = arr[i] + (arr[j] * value), where the value if index j has also been added.
    - Now, the mod of arr[i] will always be equal to arr[i] itself as the number (arr[j] * value) % value = 0.
    - Hence, now when arr[i] % value is calculated, the problem then becomes similar to case where an unchanged value is moved to another unchanged value.

***Note: Only one time changed/unchanged indexes can be moved to unchanged indexes. No movements can be made to already changed indexes.***

<a name="Arrays_KadanesAlgo"></a>
### Kadane's Algorithm (Maximum sum contigous sub array)
- To find the maximum sum contigous sub-array we maintain two variables, a local sum and a global sum.
- Local sum is the max of current local sum + arr[i] and arr[i]. The global sum is the maximum of localsum and current global sum.
- Return the list of indexes from where to where the sum is maximum. Also return the sum. Return (start index, end index, sum).
```java
public int[] KadaneAlgo(int[] arr)
{
    int n = arr.length;
    int localsum = 0;
    int globalsum = 0;
    int start = 0;
    int end = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        int c = arr[i];
        if(c + localsum >= c)
        {
            localsum += c;
        }
        else
        {
            localsum = c;
            start = i;
        }
        if(localsum > globalsum)
        {
            globalsum = localsum;
            end = i;
        }
    }
    int[] ans = new int[3];
    ans[0] = start;
    ans[1] = end;
    ans[2] = globalsum;
    return ans;

<a name="Arrays_MergeIntervals"></a>
### Merge Intervals in Arrays
In questions which require you to merge various intervals together, or find the coutn of overlapping intervals, the general method followed is as follows:
1. Make two seperate arrays, one with starting points of all intervals, one with ending points of all intervals.
2. Sort the two arrays
3. If end[i] > start[i+1], then an overlapping interval has been identified. The intervals may now be merged into one, that is start[i] to end[i+1] becomes one interval, or the count of overlapping intervals be increased.

### Range sum query
The problem statement would be "Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j". A naive solution can be to calculate the sum in O(n) time for every time a query is given. This works fine in small number of queries. But what if, number of queries is also ~n. In that case for n queries total complexity would be O(n^2). This can be reduced to O(n) using prefix sum method.
```java
class NumArray
{
    int[] prefixSum = null;
    public NumArray(int[] nums)
    {
        int n = nums.length;
        prefixSum = new int[n+1];
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        {
            prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i-1] + nums[i-1];
        }
    }
    
    public int sumRange(int i, int j)
    {
        return prefixSum[j+1] - prefixSum[i];
    }

<a name="SlideWindow_TwoPointer_String"></a>
## <p align="center"> Sliding Window, Two Pointers and Strings </p>
<a name="SWTPS_Introduction"></a>
### Introduction
We combine these topics as a lot of String questions can be solved using the sliding window and two pointers technique. String problems in general are not a particular subsection of programming but rather form sub sections of various different techinques such as DP based string problems, sliding window based string problems, backtracking based string problems and so on. In this section we cover:
1. Sliding Window Algorithm
2. Two Pointer Technique
3. String questions that can be solved using the above two technique
#### Sliding Window Algorithm
Sliding Window Algorithm is a very popular problem solving techinque used in questions generally involving contigous array/string operations. The algo can help convert nested for loops into a single for loop, resulting in a O(N) complexity instead of O(N^2).

The idea is to select a window of say size k. The window depicts the range of elements that we can have access at a time for a particular operation. We then iterate this entire window of size k over the array, that is move the window across the array, by adding elements from the right and removing from the left. The adding and removing can be reversed too but that depends from question to quetion. Using this technique in O(N) time, in a single iteration, elements in groups of k can be iterated over.

For example if the task is to find the **maximum sum contigous subarray where the subarray size is K**, what we are supposed to do is find the subarray of size K, with the maximum sum. One method to do it would be for every index i in the array, check if the array from i to i + k forms the answer we need.
```java
int maxSum = 0;
int currSum = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n-k; i++)
{
    currSum = 0;
    for(int j = 0; j < k; j++)
    {
        currSum += arr[i+j];
    }
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currSum);
}
```
The above method sovles our problem in O(NK) time.

We can potentially do better by instead of iterating over every element for k times, we can create a window of size k and calculate it's sum by moving the window forward. Initialy the window lies from 0 to k. We calculate the sum in this. Now as we move forward, the window lies from 1 to k+1 and then from 2 to k+2 until we iterate till n-k to n. While moving forward we need not calculate the entire window sum from sratch in O(1) time, rather we can do this by adding the incoming index in the window and subtracting the first outgoing index of the window. For example when moving from 0->k to 1->(k+1), we can simply just add arr[k+1] and subtract arr[0] from current sum. This has been illustrated below:
1. We compute the sum of first k elements out of n terms using a linear loop and store the sum in variable maxSum.
2. Then we will iterate linearly over the array till it reaches the end and simultaneously keep track of maxSum for every window.
3. To get the current sum just subtract the first element from the previous currSum and add the next incoming element to it.
```java
int maxSum = 0;
int currSum = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < k; i++)
{
    currSum += arr[i];
}
maxSum = currSum;
for(int i = k; i < n; i++)
{
    currSum += arr[i] - arr[i-k];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currSum);
}
```
Hence, now we can solve our problem in O(N) time. This is known as the Sliding Window Technique.

#### Two Pointer Technique
Two pointers is really an easy and effective technique which is typically used for searching pairs in a sorted array or when we search in a window which can change length from either side. This is more of a dynamically sized sliding window tehcnique. Let us consider an example. Given a sorted array A (sorted in ascending order), having N integers, find if there exists any pair of elements (A[i], A[j]) such that their sum is equal to X. A naive method would be two compare every pair in O(N^2) time.

A faster way to achieve this is using two pointers. We take two pointers, one representing the first element and other representing the last element of the array, and then we add the values kept at both the pointers. If their sum is smaller than X then we shift the left pointer to right or if their sum is greater than X then we shift the right pointer to left, in order to get closer to the sum. We keep moving the pointers until we get the sum as X. The algorithm basically uses the fact that the input array is sorted. We start the sum of extreme values (smallest and largest) and conditionally move both pointers. We move left pointer i when the sum of A[i] and A[j] is less than X. We do not miss any pair because the sum is already smaller than X. Same logic applies for right pointer j oving only when sum is > X.

Other than being used in sorted arrays, we use two pointers when we need to modify the size of a sliding window dynmically that is choose whether to decrease the size or increase it. An illustration is shown below in the next section.

### Sliding Window Template - String pattern questions
Many sliding window questions can involve strings. The questions regarding strings are generally related to finding contigous patterns under certain conditions in a parent string. In such type of questions the following template can be utilized to solve the questions. Let us assume that the question at hand is to **Find the starting indexes of all anagrams of a pattern in a string**. We utilize the sliding window technique here but with two pointers.
```java
public class Solution
{
    public List<Integer> slidingWindowTemplateForStrings(String original, String pattern)
    {
        // List to store the answer
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<Integer>();

        // If pattern is longer than string itself,
        // then no answer exists so return empty result
        if(pattern.length() > original.length())
        {
            return result;
        }

        // Create a HashMap to store the count of the characters
        // in the pattern.
        // Key: Character in pattern; Value: Count of character
		// This HashMap is for count of characters in this question,
        // but can be varied according to the questions demands.
		Map<Character, Integer> patternMap = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();
		
        char[] patternArray = pattern.toCharArray();
        for(int i = 0; i < patternArray.length; i++)
        {
            char c = patternArray[i];
            // If character exists so increase count of character
            if(patternMap.containsKey(c))
            {
                patternMap.put(c, patternMap.get(c) + 1);
            }
            // If character does not exist so add it with count 1
            else
            {
                patternMap.put(c, 1);
            }
        }

        // The size of the HashMap patternSize is the total number
        // of unique characters in the String pattern. It acts as a
        // counter to how many unique unmatech characters we have.
        int counter = patternMap.size();

        // The begin pointer and end pointer to mark the range of
        // the sliding window on the original string
        int start = 0;
        int end = 0;

        // Current length of substring which matches the target
		// As currently nothing matches so it is +INF
        int len = Integer.MAX_VALUE; 

        // Loop until the end of the original string is reached
        while(end < original.length())
        {
            // Current ending character
            char c = original.charAt(end);

            // The value in the patternMap that is the count of every
            // character in the pattern would act as a buffer when
            // matching characters with the original string. With every
            // match the buffer size would reduce by 1 until no more
            // characters are available to match.

            // If the current character exists in the pattern
            if(patternMap.containsKey(c))
            {
                // As we have got a match with the pattern, the number
                // of times we can further match this same character
                // is reduced by 1.
                patternMap.put(c, patternMap.get(c)-1);

                // If the buffer size has reached 0, we mean we have
                // completed matching the given character of the pattern
                // and hence number of remaining uncompleted characters
                // is reduced by 1.
				// The remaining unmatched characters is the counter in
                // this question. The condition to check for counter
                // reduction might be different for different questions.
                if(patternMap.get(c) == 0)
                {
                    counter--;
                }
            }

            // Move the window end to the next character
            end++;

            // If all characters of the pattern have been matched, that is
            // our counter has reached to 0, so check if the conditions
            // according to the question are satisfied or not to modify
            // the result.
            while(counter == 0)
            {
                // First character of the sliding window
                char tempc = original.charAt(start);

                // IMPORTANT:
                // CHECK FOR SATISFACTORY CONDITIONS ACCORDING TO THE
                // QUESTION TO MODIFY THE RESULT HERE. AS OF NOW LET US
                // DO IT FOR THE TASK AT HAND THAT IS TO FIND THE STARTING
                // INDEXES OF ALL ANAGRAMS OF THE PATTERN IN THE ORIGINAL
                // STRING. SO WE CHECK THAT AS THE COUNTER IS NOW 0, THAT
                // WHETHER OR NOT THE PART THAT COMPLETELY MATCHES ALL OF
                // THE CHARACTERS OF THE PATTERN IS OF THE SAME LENGTH AS
                // PATTERN OR NOT. AS, IF LENGTH IS NOT SAME IT WONT BE AN
                // ANAGRAM.
                if(end - start == pattern.length())
                {
                    // As lengths are same, 'start' is one of the starting indexes
                    result.add(start);
                }

                // If the starting character is a part of the mathcing, that is
                // character is present in the pattern
                if(patternMap.containsKey(tempc))
                {
                    // Increase the buffer size for the given character
                    // as we would be moving the start of the window to the
                    // next element. Hence, this character would now not be
                    // a part of the mathcing and thus the pattern would
                    // have a new unmatched character again
                    patternMap.put(tempc, patternMap.get(tempc) + 1);
                    // If pattern has a new unmatched character increase the
                    // counter value
                    if(patternMap.get(tempc) > 0)
                    {
                        counter++;
                    }
                }

                // Decrease the window size by incrementing the start pointer
                start++;
            }

### Primality Check (School Method)
- 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
- Prime numbers should be checked for divisibility only till sqrt(N) as no number greater than sqrt(N) would produce a factor that hasn't already been covered till sqrt(N).
- Primes other than 2 and 3 are of the form 6k +- 1
```java
boolean isPrime(int n)
{
    if(n <= 1)

### Find factors of a number
#### Find all factors
When calculating a factor, if we check that whether or not a number divides another number, if it does, at the same time we have also found another factor that is the quotient of the division.
```java
ArrayList<Integer> factorize(int n)
{
    ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    for(int i = 1; i <= sqrt(n); i++)
    {
    	if(n%i == 0)
	{
	    arr.add(i);
	    int c = n/i;
	    if(c != i)
	    {
	    	arr.add(c);
	    }
	}
    }
    return arr.sort();
}
```
#### Find all prime factors
```java
ArrayList<Integer> factorize(int n)
{
    ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    if(n == 2 || n == 3)
    {
    	arr.add(n);
    }
    while(n != 1)
    {
    	for(int i = 2; i <= sqrt(n); i++)
	{
	    if(n%i == 0)
	    {
	    	arr.add(i);
		n = n/i;
	    }
	}
	
    }
    return arr.sort();

### Binary Conversions to and from Decimal
#### From decimal to binary
We know that a decimal number is converted into binary by dividing the number repeatedly by 2 until the quotient becomes 0. The binary number is represented by adding the remainder at every step to the answer so far.
```java
String decToBin(long n)
{
    StringBuilder str = new StringBuilder("");
    while(n > 0)
    {
        str.insert(0, n%2);
        n /= 2;
    }
    return str.toString();
}
```
#### From binary to decimal
```java
long binToDec(String s)
{
    long ans = 0;
    int len = s.length() - 1;
    long base = 1;
    while(len >= 0)
    {
    	ans += base*Integer.parseInt(String.valueOf(s.charAt(len)));
        base *= 2;
        len--;
    }
    return ans;

<a name="LinkedLists"></a>
## <p align="center"> Linked Lists </p>
A linked list is a data structure in which elements are not stored in contiguous locations and are linked to each other using pointers. Linked lists consists of nodes which store the value for the node and the link to the next node to which it is connected. The lists can be single directed or double directed lists.

Linked lists generally have a head which is the only directly accessible element of the list. The structure looks like Head -> Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node3

<a name="LL_SinglyLinkedList"></a>
### Singly Linked List
A singly linked list means that every element is linked with only the next element in the forward direction. Hence, you may access the next element of a node but not the previous one.
```java
class LinkedList
{
    Node head = null;
}

class Node
{
    int value = null;
    Node next = null;
    
    public Node(int val, Node nex)
    {
        value = val;
        next = nex;
    }
    
    public Node(int val)
    {
        value = val;
    }
}
```
#### Insert Element
Linked list can have three types of insertions, namely, at the beginning, at the end and after a specific given node.
```java
// These functions are supposed to be a part of the Linked List class

// Swap current head with the new node. Link new node to prev head.
void insertAtBeginning(int x)
{
    Node temp = head;
    head = new Node(x);
    head.next = temp;
}

/* Iterate the list till the end. If the list is empty, make this node the head,
else link the last node of the list to the new node. */
void insertAtEnd(int x)
{
    Node temp = head;
    if(temp == null)
    {
        head = new Node(x);
        return;
    }
    while(temp.next!=null)
    {
        temp = temp.next;
    }
    Node newNode = new Node(x);
    temp.next = newNode;
}

/* Link 'node' to the new node. The previous next element of 'node'
would now be linked to the new node. In certain questions maybe the pointer
to the node would not be given but the value be shared. Iterate the list
to reach the node first and then follow the below process.*/
void insertAfter(Node node, int x)
{
    if(node == null)
    {
        return;
    }
    Node temp = node.next;
    Node newNode = new Node(x);
    newNode.next = temp;
    node.next = newNodee;
}
```
<a href="#Contents">Back to contents</a>

#### Delete Element
```java
// These functions are supposed to be a part of the Linked List class

/* This function deletes the node at position x. Only the head of the list
is given. WE first check if head is valid or not. Then we check if the node
to be deleted is the head. If yes, so we proceed by just changing the head.
If not, so we then iterate to reach the node previous to the one that is to be
deleted. Then link this current node to the next node of the node to be deleted.*/

//ALWAYS REMEMBER TO DELINK THE NODE TO BE DELETED.

Node deleteNode(Node head, int x)
{
    Node temp = head;
    if(temp == null)
    {
        return temp;
    }
    if(x == 1)
    {
        head = head.next;
        return head;
    }
    Node prev = temp;
    temp = temp.next;
    int count = 2;
    while(temp != null)
    {
        if(count == x)
        {
            prev.next = temp.next;
            // Delinking the node
            temp.next = null;
            temp = prev.next;
            break;
        }
        count++;
        prev = temp;
        temp = temp.next;
    }
    return head;
}
```

{
    StringBuilder sbf = new StringBuilder("");
    while(head != null)
    {
        sbf.append(head.data + " ");
        head = head.next;
    }
    System.out.print(sbf.toString());

<a name="LL_Cycle"></a>
### Detect Cycle in a Linked List
Given a linked list head pointer, detect whether or not hte given linked list contains a cycle or not. A naive solution with O(n) space complexity and O(n) time complexity would be to use a HashMap to detect when a node is repeated. Instead we may use the two pointers method.

**Two pointers method:** We keep two pointers, one pointing to the head(slow pointer) and one to head.next(fast pointer). The slow pointer would be moving one step at a time, that is, slowPointer = slowPointer.next, while the fast pointer would move two steps at a time, fastPointer = fastPointer.next.next. The idea is that if a cycle exists, the two pointers would meet at some point. Now three cases arise:
1. N1 -> Fast -> Slow -> N2 : In this case in the next iteration Fast would meet slow.
2. N1 -> Fast -> N2 -> Slow -> N3 : In this case in the next iteration, the condition becomes N1 -> Fast -> Slow -> N2 and hence similar to case 1.
3. N1 -> Fast -> N2 -> N3 -> Slow -> N4 : In this case in the next iteration, the condition becomes N1 -> Fast -> N2 -> Slow -> N3 and hence similar to case 2.

Thus in a maximum of 3 loops in constant space a cycle can be detected. If a cycly doesn't exist the fast pointer would reach null and end the loop.
```java
public boolean detectLoop(Node head)
{
    if(head == null || head.next == null)
    {
        return false;
    }
    Node pointer1 = head;
    Node pointer2 = head.next;
    while(pointer1 != pointer2)
    {
        if(pointer1 == null || pointer2 == null || pointer2.next == null)
        {
            return false;
        }
        pointer1 = pointer1.next;
        pointer2 = pointer2.next.next;
    }
    return true;
}
```

<a name="LL_Reverse"></a>
### Reverse a linked list
To reverse a linked list, we start from the head and point it to null. The further links are modified in the following way:<br>
For every link Node1 -> Node2, we modify to make it Node2 -> Node1. Hence, everytime we reach a new node, we need access to the previous node as well. Thus the two things needed would be:
1. Point head to null.
2. Point every new node to its previous node

Also take note, that the final answer returned should be the new head of the reversed linked list, which is the last elelement of the original linked list.
```java
public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head)
{
    // Prev stores the previous node. This is null in case of head.
    ListNode prev = null;
    ListNode curr = head;
    while(curr!=null)
    {
        // Store the next element of the current node first, before
        // pointing the current node to it's previous element.
        ListNode temp = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        
        // Set the new prev to the current element.
        prev = curr;
        
        // Set the new current to the next element which was stored in temp.
        curr = temp;
    }
    return prev;
}
```

<a name="LL_FindMid"></a>
### Find middle in a linked list
To find the middle element in a linked list simply use the two pointer appraoch. One pointer moves one step at a point, while the other moves two steps at a point. This way, when the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow reaches the middle.
```java
public Node findMid(Node head)
{
    // Routine check for empty list or single node list.
    if(head == null || head.next == null)
    {
        return head;
    }
    
    // Fast and slow pointer for splitting list in half.
    ListNode fast = head;
    ListNode slow = head;
    
    // We dont need to check for slow as fast is always ahead of it
    while(fast!=null && fast.next!=null)
    {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }
    return slow;
}
```

<a name="LL_MergeSorted"></a>
### Merge two sorted linked lists
The idea is similar to merging two sorted arrays. The key is to remember that the two input lists are already sorted indivudally. We simply iterate both the lists and compare the node values one by one. If Node1 < Node2, then append Node1 to the final answer and we move Node1 to Node1.next. The same is done for Node2 if Node2 <= Node1. As soon as either of the list1 or list2 reaches null, we append all the remaining nodes of the other list directly to the final answer.

An example would be as follows:<br>
List1 : 2 -> 4 -> 8 -> null<br>
List2 : 3 -> 6 -> 14 -> 17 -> null

<ins>Step 1</ins>:<br>
We compare 2 and 3.<br>
List1 : **2** -> 4 -> 8 -> null<br>
List2 : **3** -> 6 -> 14 -> 17 -> null<br>
As 2 < 3, we add 2 to the final answer and move 2 to 4.<br>
Answer: 2

<ins>Step 2</ins>:<br>
We compare 4 and 3.<br>
List1 : **4** -> 8 -> null<br>
List2 : **3** -> 6 -> 14 -> 17 -> null<br>
As 3 < 4, we add 3 to the final answer and move 3 to 6.<br>
Answer: 2 -> 3

<ins>Step 3</ins>:<br>
We compare 4 and 6.<br>
List1 : **4** -> 8 -> null<br>
List2 : **6** -> 14 -> 17 -> null<br>
As 4 < 6, we add 4 to the final answer and move 4 to 8.<br>
Answer: 2 -> 3 -> 4

<ins>Step 4</ins>:<br>
We compare 8 and 6.<br>
List1 : **8** -> null<br>
List2 : **6** -> 14 -> 17 -> null<br>
As 6 < 8, we add 6 to the final answer and move 6 to 14.<br>
Answer: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6

<ins>Step 5</ins>:<br>
We compare 8 and 14.<br>
List1 : **8** -> null<br>
List2 : **14** -> 17 -> null<br>
As 8 < 14, we add 8 to the final answer and reach end of list 1.<br>
Answer: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8

<ins>Step 6</ins>:<br>
List1 : **null**<br>
List2 : **14** -> 17 -> null<br>
As we reach null in list1, we add all the nodes of list2 to answer directly<br>
Answer: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 14 -> 17 -> null

The code would be as folows:
```java
public ListNode mergeTwoLists(Node l1, Node l2)
{
    // temp1 and temp2 nodes to iterate list1 and list2 respectively.
    Node temp1 = l1;
    Node temp2 = l2;
    
    // We need a new node to store the final answer.
    Node answer = new ListNode(-1);
    
    // We iterate the final asnwer list using ret. If we would have done
    // this directly through the Node answer itself, we would have lost
    // track of the head of the answer list. We need to keep track of the
    // head to return it at the end.
    Node ret = answer;
    
    while(temp1 != null && temp2!= null)
    {
        if(temp1.val < temp2.val)
        {
            ret.next = temp1;
            temp1 = temp1.next;
        }
        else
        {
            ret.next = temp2;
            temp2 = temp2.next;
        }
        ret = ret.next;
    }
    
    if(temp1 != null)
    {
        ret.next = temp1;
    }
    
    if(temp2 != null)
    {
        ret.next = temp2;
    }
    
    // Return answer.next as answer is a dummy node with value 0 which
    // is not a part of either of the input lists.
    return answer.next;
}

### Sort a linked list
Given a linked list, the task is to sort it. The idea used is of MergeSort and is similar to how it works for the arrays in general. We divide the list into two halves. Each half is individually sorted and then merged together again. As we have dsicussed splitting the list into two halves and merging two sorted lists above, I would not be discussing them again here. We directly look at the code:
```java
public Node sortList(Node head)
{
    // Routine check for empty list or single node list.
    if(head == null || head.next == null)
    {
        return head;
    }
    
    // Fast and slow pointer for splitting list in half.
    // A new pointer temp is introduced. Temp is used to store the
    // ending node of the first half of the list. As our aim is not
    // to just simply find the middle element, but to split the list
    // into two. Hence the first half of the list would need an ending
    // element and that would be temp.
    ListNode fast = head;
    ListNode slow = head;
    ListNode temp = slow;
    
    while(fast!=null && fast.next!=null)
    {
        temp = slow;
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }
    
    // Now temp.next is set to null as temp was the ending node of the first
    // half. As soon as we set temp.next = null, we have two lists a our hands.
    // One starts from head and ends at temp. The other starts from slow and
    // ends at fast.
    temp.next = null;
    
    // Individually sort the two lists.
    Node front = sortList(head);
    Node back = sortList(slow);
    
    // Merge the sorted lists.
    return mergeTwoLists(front,back);
}

public Node mergeTwoLists(Node l1, Node l2)
{
    Node temp1 = l1;
    Node temp2 = l2;
    Node answer = new ListNode(-1);
    Node ret = answer;
    while(temp1 != null && temp2!= null)
    {
        if(temp1.val < temp2.val)
        {
            ret.next = temp1;
            temp1 = temp1.next;
        }
        else
        {
            ret.next = temp2;
            temp2 = temp2.next;
        }
        ret = ret.next;
    }
    if(temp1 != null)
    {
        ret.next = temp1;
    }
    if(temp2 != null)
    {
        ret.next = temp2;
    }
    return answer.next;
}
```

<a name="LL_Intersect"></a>
### Intersection of two linked lists
Given 2 linked lists, your task would be to find the intersection point of the two lists if they intersect else the answer would be null.

**Intuition:** Try to understand the intuition point by point.
1. If the two lists intersect then after the point of intersection, the length of the remaining lists would be the same for both as the list would be common after that point.
2. Hence, any difference in length of the two lists, arises before the point of intersection.
3. Let us assume this difference in length to be 'i'. If we remove this difference in length by starting the smaller list from the 1st node and starting the longer list from the ith node, and then compare the nodes of the list while iterating them one by one, if an intersection exists, we will definitely find it before reach the end.

If you have understood the intuition, then task at hand now would be to identify this difference in length. So to do this we have the following two options:
1. Iterate both the lists till they reach the end. If lengths differ, one will reach the end faster. Count the nodes, the longer list takes to reach the end from this point onwards. This is the difference in length.
2. We actually would not need the difference in length in this question. What we actually need is to start iterating the longer list directly from the i'th node if 'i' is the difference in length. Hence, as soon as the pointer of the smaller list hits null, switch it's value to point to the head of the longer list. This way by the time the pointer of the longer list hits null, the first pointer would have iterated the longer list by 'i' steps. Then point the pointer of the longer list to head of the smaller list and start comparing nodes.

The code would be as follows:
```java
public Node getIntersectionNode(Node headA, Node headB)
{
    if(headA == null || headB == null)
    {
        return null;
    }
    Node pointer1 = headA;
    Node pointer2 = headB;
    boolean check1 = false;
    boolean check2 = false;
    while(pointer1!=pointer2)
    {
        pointer1 = pointer1.next;
        pointer2 = pointer2.next;
        if(pointer1 == null)
        {
            if(!check1)
            {
                check1 = true;
                pointer1 = headB;
            }
            else
            {
                return null;
            }
        }
        if(pointer2 == null)
        {
            pointer2 = headA;
        }
    }
    return pointer1;
}
```

<a name="LL_RemoveDuplicates"></a>
### Remove duplicates from a sorted list
Removing duplicates from a linked list can be a two way question. One type can be to simply remove al duplicates and keep only one occurence for every element. This case is is similar to first searching for a duplicate and then simply deleteing every deuplicate node. This can be achieved by keeping a previous pointer, which at every point is compared to the current pointer, and if found equa in value, we link the previous pointer to the current.next element and move ahead. The pseudocode would be as follows:
```java
// Set value of prev node to anything other than head.val.
// Let us assume 0 at this point
Node removeuplicates(Node head)
{
    Node prev = new Node(head.val + 1);
    Node curr = head;
    while(curr!=null)
    {
        if(curr.val == prev.val)
        {
            prev.next = curr.next;
        }
        else
        {
            prev = curr;
        }
        curr = curr.next;
    }
    return head;
}
```
A modified version of the question can be when you are asked to remove all duplicate nodes and keep only unique nodes, meaning, that in the list 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3, the answer would be 2 -> 3 and not 1 -> 2 -> 3. This can act as a sliding window question where we maintain three pointer, previous, current and next. If previous != current and current != next, only then would the current element be unique. The code would need simple trivial changes from the code above to work as follows:
```java
public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head)
{
    if(head == null || head.next == null)
    {
        return head;
    }
    ListNode answer = new ListNode(0);
    if(head.val == 0)
    {
        answer.val = 1;
    }
    ListNode ret = answer;
    ListNode prev = answer;
    ListNode curr = head;
    ListNode next = head.next;
    
    while(curr!=null && curr.next!=null)
    {
        if(prev.val != curr.val)
        {
            if(curr.val != curr.next.val)
            {
                ret.next = curr;
                ret = ret.next;
            }
        }
        prev = curr;
        curr = curr.next;
    }
    
    if(prev.val != curr.val)
    {
        ret.next = curr;
    }
    else
    {
        ret.next = null;
    }
    return answer.next;
}
```

<a name="LL_Double"></a>
### Doubly Linked Lists
A doubly linked list is different from a singly linked list that it holds two pointers both to the front and the end of the list. The comparison between a doubly linked list vs a singly linked list as follows:
1. Bidirectional traversal:<br> A doubly linked list due to presence of previous pointers can be traversed in reverse as well.

2. Easy deletion:<br> Deletion is easy as you have access to previous and next of every node.

3. Easy insertion before a node:<br> Again due to previous pointer, you can easily add a node in between.

4. More space:<br> Consumes twice the sapce as a singly linked list.

5. More complex operations:<br> The extra pointer is not always beneficial, as it makes simple operation complex as now you have to check two pointers at every instance for a list.

<a name="SQ_Stack"></a>
### Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure which follows a LIFO(Last In First Out) pattern. What this means is that can be inserted again and again into the stack but the only data that can be retrieved is the last element that has been inserted.

A stacks supports the following basic operations:
1. Push: To insert an element at the top of the stack
2. Pop: To remove the top element from the stack
3. Peek: To get the value of the top element of the stack
4. isEmpty: To check if the stack is empty or not

All the operations in a stack take place in O(1) time. A stack can be implemented either using arrays or linked lists.

#### Array implementation of Stack
Pros:
1. Easy to implement
2. Faster as no pointers

Cons:
1. Not dynamic in size
```java
class Stack
{
    // The stack can have a fixed maximum size as arrays are not dynamic
    static final int SIZE = 1000;
    // A pointer for the top value of the stack
    int top;
    int a[] = new int[SIZE];
  
    public Stack() 
    { 
        top = -1; 
    }
    
    public boolean isEmpty()
    {
        if(top < 0)
        {
            return true;
        } 
    }
    
    public boolean push(int x) 
    { 
        if (top >= (SIZE - 1))
        {
            return false; 
        }
        else
        {
            top++;
            a[top] = x; 
            return true; 
        } 
    } 
    
    public int pop() 
    { 
        if (top < 0)
        {
            return Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        } 
        else
        {
            int x = a[top];
            top--;
            return x; 
        }
    }
    
    public int peek() 
    {
        if (top < 0)
        { 
            return Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        }
        else
        {
            int x = a[top]; 
            return x; 
        } 
    } 
} 
```

#### Linked List implementation of Stack
Pros:
1. Dynamic in size, thus can expand

Cons:
1. Difficult to implement
2. Takes more memory due to pointers
```java
class Node
{
    int data; 
    Node next; 
    
    public Node(int data) 
    { 
        this.data = data; 
    }
}
    
class Stack
{
    Node root = null;
  
    public boolean isEmpty() 
    { 
        if (root == null)
        { 
            return true; 
        } 
        else
        {
            return false; 
        }
    } 
  
    public void push(int data) 
    { 
        Node newNode = new Node(data); 
  
        if (root == null)
        { 
            root = newNode; 
        } 
        else
        { 
            Node temp = root; 
            root = newNode; 
            newNode.next = temp; 
        }
    }
    
    public int pop() 
    { 
        int popped = Integer.MIN_VALUE; 
        if (root != null)
        {
            popped = root.data; 
            root = root.next; 
        } 
        return popped; 
    }
  
    public int peek() 
    { 
        if (root == null)
        { 
            return Integer.MIN_VALUE; 
        } 
        else
        { 
            return root.data; 
        }

<a name="SQ_Queue"></a>
### Queues
A queue is very similar to a stack with the only difference being that the removal order is first in first out.

A queue supports the following basic operations:
1. Enqueue: To insert an element at the rear of the queue
2. Dequeue: To remove the first element from the queue
3. Front: To get the value of the first element of the queue
4. Rear: To get the value of the last element of the queue
5. isEmpty: To check if the stack is empty or not

All the operations in a queue take place in O(1) time. A queue can be implemented either using arrays or linked lists.

#### Array implementation of queue
```java
class Queue
{
	public int front;
	public int rear;
	public int size;
	// Capacity is different from size as size is number of elements
    // and capacity is the maximum size possible
	public int capacity;
	public int array[];

	public Queue(int cap)
	{
		capacity = cap;
		front = size = 0;
		rear = cap - 1;
		array = new int[capacity];
	}

	public boolean isFull()
	{
		if (size == capacity)
		{
			return true;
		}
		return false;
	}

	boolean isEmpty()
	{
		if (size == 0)
		{
			return true;
		}
		return false;
	}

	/*
    The enqueue and dequeue functions are to be written with care. Unlike
    stack it is not the last element that has to be removed. The starting
    of the array has to be modified.
    Hence insertion and deletion are %capacity.
    */
	public void enqueue(int item)
	{
		if (this.size == this.capacity)
		{
			return;
		}
		rear = (rear + 1) % capacity;
		size++;
		array[rear] = item;
	}

	public int dequeue()
	{
		if (size == 0)
		{
			return Integer.MIN_VALUE;
		}
		int item = array[front];
		front = (front + 1) % this.capacity;
		size--;
		return item;
	}

	public int front()
	{
		if (size == 0)
		{
			return Integer.MIN_VALUE;
		}
		return array[front];
	}

	public int rear()
	{
		if (size == 0)
		{
			return Integer.MIN_VALUE;
		}
		return array[rear];
	}
}
```

#### Linked list implementation of queue

class Queue
{
	Node front, rear;

	public Queue()
	{
		front = rear = null;
	}

	public void enqueue(int key)
	{
		Node temp = new Node(key);
		if (rear == null)
		{
			front = rear = temp;
			return;
		}
		rear.next = temp;
		rear = temp;
	}

	public Node dequeue()
	{
		if (front == null)
		{
			return null;
		}
		Node temp = front;
		front = front.next;
		if (front == null)
		{
			rear = null;
		}
		return temp;
	}
	
	public Node front()
	{
		return front;
	}
	
	public Node rear()
	{
		return rear;
	}
}
```

#### Inbuilt JAVA interface for queue
All operation are O(1)

Queue A = new LinkedList(); 
A.add(new Integer(newElement));
A.poll();
A.isEmpty();
A.size();
A.peek();
```

### Priority Queues
A priority queue is a type of a queue in which elements are removed on the basis of their priority. The item with the highest priority is the one which is always removed first. Priority queue can be directly implemented in java in the following way:
```java
PriorityQueue<Integer> A = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
A.add(new Integer(newElement)); //O(logN)
A.poll(); //O(logN)
A.isEmpty(); //O(1)
A.size(); //O(1)
A.peek(); //O(1)
A.remove(Onject); //O(n)
```
<a href="#Contents">Back to contents</a>

#### Priority Queue with comparator in JAVA
A priority queue can be made for custom classes as well. An example for a class Pair would be as follows:
```java
// How to define a PriorityQueue for a custom class.
PriorityQueue<Pair> pQueue = new PriorityQueue<Pair>(new Comparison());

// Defining the comparator class for the queue
class Comparison implements Comparator<Pair>
{
    @Override
    public int compare(Pair p1, Pair p2)
    {
        if (p1.value > p2.value)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        else if(p1.value < p2.value)
        {
            return -1;
        }
        else
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}

class Pair
{
    public int key;
    public int value;
    
    public Pair(int k, int v)
    {
        key = k;
        value = v;
    }
}
```

<a name="SQ_TreeSet"></a>
### Tree Set
A tree set is a better version of priority queue. It can be used as a double sided priority queue. It can also take in a customized comparator just like PriorityQueue. The reason it is preferred over priorityqueue is that it has a O(logN) remove element complexity.

Treeset does not allow duplicate values. TreeSet is basically an implementation of a self-balancing binary search tree like a Red-Black Tree. Therefore operations like add, remove, and search take O(log(N)) time. The reason is that in a self-balancing tree, it is made sure that the height of the tree is always O(log(N)) for all the operations. Therefore, this is considered as one of the most efficient data structure in order to store the huge sorted data and perform operations on it. However, operations like printing N elements in the sorted order takes O(N) time.
```java
TreeSet<Pair> trSet = new TreeSet<Pair>(new Comparison());
trSet.add(new Pair()); //O(Log n)
trSet.remove(Object o); //O(Log n)
trSet.first() // O(1)
trSet.last() // O(1)
trSet.pollFirst() //O(Log n)
trSet.pollLast() //O(Log n)
trSet.size() //O(1)
trSet.isEmpty() //O(1)

// Defining the comparator class for the TreeSet
class Comparison implements Comparator<Pair>
{
    @Override
    public int compare(Pair p1, Pair p2)
    {
        if (p1.value > p2.value)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        else if(p1.value < p2.value)
        {
            return -1;
        }
        else
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}

class Pair
{
    public int key;
    public int value;
    
    public Pair(int k, int v)
    {
        key = k;
        value = v;
    }
}
```

### Introduction
Trees are heirarchical data structure and hence differ from linked lists, arrays, stacks and queues in functionality as they are all linear data structures. The topmost node of a tree is called the root. In a connection between the nodes, that is when an edge in the tree connects two nodes, the ndoe where the edge begins is called a parent node, and where the edge ends is called the child node. Moreover, in trees, there are no back edges, that means edges are pssobile only from a higher level to a lower level. Nodes which do not have any children are called leaf nodes.

A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child. Binary trees provide moderate access and modification speeds. The operation search, delete, insert are all O(n) in a binary tree.
```java
// Node class to represent nodes in the tree
class Node
{
    // Value of the node
    int key;
    // Left and right children are also nodes
    Node left = null;
    Node right = null;

    public Node(int value)
    {
        key = value;
    }
	
	public Node(int value, Node r, Node l)
    {
        key = value;
		right = r;
		left = l;
    }
}

// Class for binary tree
class BinaryTree
{
    // All we need is the root of the tree
    // to run any algorithm on the tree
    Node root = null;
    
    public BinaryTree(int key)
    {
        root = new Node(key);
    }
}
```
Properties of a binary tree:
1. The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree at a level 'l' is 2^l. Root is level 0.
2. Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height 'h' is 2^h – 1. Root is at height 1.
3. In a binary tree with N nodes, minimum height possible is Log(N+1).
4. In binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.
5. A full binary tree is one in which all nodes have either 0 or 2 children. This means that all nodes other than leaves have 2 children.
6. A complete binary tree is a tree where in only the last level is allowed to be incomplete and that all the nodes in the last level are to as left as possible.

### Tree traversals
There are three types of tree traversals:
1. Inorder: Inorder traversal is when the left subtree of a node is listed first, then the node and then the right subtree of the node. Both left and right subtrees are also listed in inorder fashion.
2. Preorder: Prorder traversal is when the node is listed first, then the left subtree of the node and then the right subtree of the node. Both left and right subtrees are also listed in preorder fashion.
3. Postorder: Postorder traversal is when the left subtree of a node is listed first, then the right subtree of the node and then the node at the end. Both left and right subtrees are also listed in postorder fashion.
```java
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \     \
   4   5     6
            /
           7
```
For the tree above the traversal would be as follows:
1. Inorder: 4 2 5 1 3 7 6
2. Preorder: 1 2 4 5 3 6 7
3. Postoreder: 4 5 2 7 6 3 1

These tree traversals can be achieved using recursion and stacks. The idea in both the approaches is similar and has been implemented below:
```java
// INORDER TRAVERSAL - RECURSIVE

{
    ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    public List<Integer> inorderTraversal(TreeNode root)

        if(root == null)
        {
            return ans;
        }
        inorderTraversal(root.left);
        ans.add(root.val);
        inorderTraversal(root.right);
        return ans;
    }
}

// INORDER TRAVERSAL - ITERATIVE STACK

        while (curr != null || !stack.isEmpty())
        {
            // Traverse till extreme left and
            // keep adding to stack
            while (curr != null)
            {
                stack.push(curr);
                curr = curr.left;
            }
            // At this point top of stack is current extreme left element
            // We pop the head, and then add it to the asnwer
            // The new head would now be the parent of the popped element
            curr = stack.pop();
            ans.add(curr.val);
            // We set the current element to the right child of the
            // popped element
            // If the right child exists, then in the next iteration
            // it would come to the top of the stack
            curr = curr.right;
        }
        return ans;

### Find postorder traversal from given inorder and preorder
The questions is that given in-order and pre-order traversal of a binary tree, can we output the postorder traversal for the same. The question can be solved recursively, by using the pre-order traversal to decide roots and the inorder subtree to decide elements of the left and right subtrees for each root.
We know that inorder follows the format Left Root Right and preorder follows the format ROOT LEFT RIGHT. Hence, the first element of the preorder will be the root of the tree, and in the inorder, elements to the left of the root will be left subtree and those to right will be from right subtree. For example,<br>
Inorder = { 4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 6 }<br>
Preorder = { 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6 }<br>
Hence, from the preorder the root of the tree would be 1, and from the inorder the elements of the left subtree would be { 4, 2, 5 } and those of the right subtree would be { 3, 6 }.

Now solving for the left subtree, moving on to the next root element in the preorder, we know that 2 would be the root of the subtree, and the subtree as obtained from inorder is { 4, 2, 5 }. We repeat the same process again to get new left and right subtrees as { 4 } and { 5 } respectively and the root from preorder as 2.

This process can be repeated recursively to complete the entire tree. Now to solve the question, we can either build the tree first and then print the postorder traversal of the tree, or instead we can get the postorder traversal directly while building the tree as shown in the code below:
```java
class Solution
{
    // Index for keeping track of root element in preOrder
    static int pIndex = 0;

    // Return postOrder
    public static ArrayList<Integer> findPostOrder()
    {
        int[] inOrder = { 4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 6 };
        int[] prOrder = { 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6 };
        int n = inOrder.length;
        // HashMap to store the index of elements in inOrder
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> inMap = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            // Fill HashMap
            inMap.put(inOrder[i], i);
        }
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        findPostOrderUtil(inMap, prOrder, ans, 0, n);
        return ans;
    }

    // Input is given as HashMap, the preOrder traversal,
	// final asnwer arraylist and the starting and ending points of subtrees
    public static void findPostOrderUtil(HashMap<Integer, Integer> inMap, int[] prOrder, ArrayList<Integer> ans, int start, int end)
    {
        // If start is same as end, this means that epmty subtree
        // has been reached. So do nothing.
        if(start == end)
        {
            return;
        }
        // The value of the root for the subtree
        int value = prOrder[pIndex];
        // The index of root in inOrder
        // Everything right to this index forms right subtree
        // Everything left to this index forms left subtree
        int rootIndex = inMap.get(value);
        
        // Move preOrder index to next root
        pIndex++;
        // Solve for left subtree
        findPostOrderUtil(inMap, prOrder, ans, start, rootIndex);
        // Solve for right subtree
        findPostOrderUtil(inMap, prOrder, ans, rootIndex+1, end);
        // As it is PostOrder, the actuall root is added after
        // left and right subtrees are added.
        ans.add(value);
    }
}

### Find all possible binary trees with given Inorder Traversal
The task is to find all possible tree formations from a given inorder traversal. We output the trees as their preorder traversals.

We from all possbile inorder traversal trees recursively by selecting all elements as root once and by forming left and right subtrees from elements to the left and right of selected root respectively.

The code is as foolows:
```java
class Solution
{
    public static void findAllTrees()
    {
        int[] inOrder = { 4, 5, 7, 8 };
        ArrayList<Node> ans = findAllTreesUtil(inOrder, 0, inOrder.length);
        for(int i = 0; i < ans.size(); i++)
        {
            System.out.println(preOrderTraversal(ans.get(i)));
        }
    }

    // Input is the inOrder traversal, and starting and ending point of subtree
    // Output is the list of root nodes for all the trees formed
    public static ArrayList<Node> findAllTreesUtil(int []inOrder, int start, int end)
    {
        // List of root nodes
        ArrayList<Node> ans = new ArrayList<Node>();
        // If the starting and ending elements
        // are same then this means we have reached
        // the null children.
        if(end == start)
        {
            // Add null as the subtree root.
            ans.add(null);
            return ans;
        }
        // For all elements from start to end
        // we make every element root once
        for(int i = start; i < end; i++)
        {
            // List of roots of all left subtrees with
            // element 'i' as parent root
            ArrayList<Node> leftTrees = findAllTreesUtil(inOrder, start, i);
            // List of roots of all right subtrees with
            // element 'i' as parent root
            ArrayList<Node> rightTrees = findAllTreesUtil(inOrder, i+1, end);
            // For all left subtrees possible
            for(int j = 0; j < leftTrees.size(); j++)
            {
                // For all right subtrees possible
                for(int k = 0; k < rightTrees.size(); k++)
                {
                    // Create node with 'i' as root
                    Node n = new Node(inOrder[i]);
                    // Add left and right subtree
                    n.left = leftTrees.get(j);
                    n.right = rightTrees.get(k);
                    // Add this node to the list of all trees with elements
                    // from start to end
                    ans.add(n);
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

    // Simple preorder traversal for output

### Binary tree level order traverssal
The level order traversal for a tree is when we list nodes of the tree level by level starting from the left to right. The code is trivial and is a simple implementation of BFS on a tree where we add the nodes to a queue. For ever y node in queue, we pop the head, add the popped nodes left and right child to queue respectively and then print the popped head. This is repeated till the queue becomes empty. This way all nodes on a particular level are treated first before their children.
```java
class Solution
{
    public static ArrayList<Integer> levelOrderTraversal(Node root)
    {
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<Node>();
        queue.add(root);
        Node curr = null;
        while(!queue.isEmpty())
        {
            curr = queue.poll();
            if(curr.left != null)
            {
                queue.add(curr.left);
            }
            if(curr.right != null)
            {
                queue.add(curr.right);
            }
            ans.add(curr.value);
        }
        return ans;
    }   
}

// Class node for forming the tree
class Node
{
    int value = 0;
    Node right = null;
    Node left = null;

    public Node(int v)
    {
        value = v;
    }
}

### Binary tree zigzag traversal - Level order in spiral
The zigzag level traversal is a modification of the simple level order traversal. For every lternate level we need to change the order of printing from left to right to right to left. This can achived in O(n) time using two different stacks. The approach is as foolows:
1. Create two empty stacks, say A and B, add all nodes of level 1, that is the root, to A.
2. Now pop elements from stack A and add them to the answer, and for every popped elemnt, push the right and left child of the node to stack B. Now as the right and left child were pushed in order, therefore stack B has left child at top and right child below in the stack. Hence, <ins>stack B</ins> would represent a <ins>Left to Right</ins> printing pattern.
3. For every node in stack B, now pop the head and add it to the answer. For every popped head, add the left and right children to stack A. This way, now when <ins>stack A</ins> is popped it will result in a <ins>Right to Left</ins> oredering.
4. Repeat the process above till both stacks become empty and return the final result.

In short, we alternatively add level to different stacks, One stack follows a push right before left order and the other follows a push left before right order. This way, when popping, alternate orders are followed.
```java
class Solution
{
    public static ArrayList<Integer> levelOrderTraversal(Node root)
    {
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        Stack<Node> stackA = new Stack<Node>();
        Stack<Node> stackB = new Stack<Node>();
        stackA.push(root);
        while(!stackA.isEmpty() || !stackB.isEmpty())
        {
            Node temp = null;
            while(!stackA.isempty())
            {
                temp = stackA.pop();
                ans.add(temp.data);
                if(temp.right != null)
                {
                    stackB.push(temp.right);
                }
                if(temp.left != null)
                {
                    stackB.push(temp.left);
                }
            }
            while(!stackB.isempty())
            {
                temp = stackB.pop();
                ans.add(temp.data);
                if(temp.left != null)
                {
                    stackA.push(temp.left);
                }
                if(temp.right != null)
                {
                    stackA.push(temp.right);
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

// Class node for forming the tree
class Node
{
    int data = 0;
    Node right = null;
    Node left = null;

    public Node(int v)
    {
        data = v;

### Binary tree reverse level order traversal
Here we are required to print the level order traversal of a tree in reverse order. This means that the last elvel should be printed first and then the second last and so on, with the root being printed last.

This can be achieved using a stack. Values added to stack are put in a LIFO order that is the element put in last would be taken out first. o if for every level we were to put values in a right to left order till the very last level, we would eventually be pulling out values in left to right order starting from the last level. This is exactly what is needed. For example for three below:
```java
          1
        /   \
       2     3
      / \     \
     4   5     6
              /
             7
```
The stack would be filled like this by traversing the tree level by level from right to left:
1 3 2 6 5 4 7
The stack when popped would result in output similar to reverse printing level from left to right:
7 4 5 6 2 3 1
```java
class Solution
{
    public static ArrayList<Integer> levelOrderTraversal(Node root)
    {
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        Stack<Node> stack = new Stack<Node>();
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<Node>();
        queue.add(root);
        Node n = null;
        while(!queue.isEmpty())
        {
            n = queue.poll();
            stack.push(n);
            if(n.right != null)
            {
                queue.add(n.right);
            }
            if(n.left != null)
            {
                queue.add(n.left);
            }
        }
        while(!stack.isEmpty())
        {
            // System.out.print(stack.pop().data + " ");
            ans.add(stack.pop().data);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

### Binary tree diagnoal traversal
The question is to print the tree in a digaonal order. This means that levels are decided diagonally. The root and all it's right nodes form level 1, the second level is root's left node and the left nodes of all the right nodes of root and so on. Example:
```java
           1
         /   \
        2     3
       / \     \
      4   5     6
               / \
              7  10
```
In the above tree,<br>
The first level would be: 1 3 6 10<br>
The second level would be: 2 5 7<br>
The third level would be: 4<br>

For a better explanation of the problem statement refer to this image: https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/d1-1.png

This question can be solved recursively by adding nodes to a map of different diagonal levels. Let us consider we have a hashmap of the form HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<Integer>>, where the key is the level number and the value which is the array list is list of nodes on that diagonal level. So our task now is that for each level, we add values to the list in the following way:
1. For the element on that level, add the element to the list of that level.
2. Add the right node of the element to the same level as the element.
3. Add the left node of the element to the next level as the element.
4. Repeat the process for the right and left nodes of the element.
	
The code is as follows:
```java
class Solution
{    
    public static void diagonalTraversal(Node root)
    {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>();
        HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<Integer>> hMap = new HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<Integer>>();
        diagonalTraversalUtil(hMap, 0, root);
        for(int i = 0; i < hMap.size(); i++)
        {
            ans.add(hMap.get(i));
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < ans.size(); i++)
        {
            System.out.println(ans.get(i));
        }
    }

    public static void diagonalTraversalUtil(HashMap<Integer, ArrayList<Integer>> hMap, int dist, Node node)
    {
        if(node == null)
        {
            return;
        }
        ArrayList<Integer> arr = hMap.get(dist);
        if(arr == null)
        {
            arr = new ArrayList<Integer>();
            arr.add(node.data);
        }
        else
        {
            arr.add(node.data);
        }
        hMap.put(dist, arr);
        diagonalTraversalUtil(hMap, dist + 1, node.left);
        diagonalTraversalUtil(hMap, dist, node.right);
    }
}

// Class node for forming the tree
class Node
{
    int data = 0;
    Node right = null;
    Node left = null;

    public Node(int v)
    {
        data = v;
    }

### Deletion in a binary tree
Given a binary tree, delete a node from it by making sure that tree shrinks from the bottom (i.e. the deleted node is replaced by bottom most and rightmost node).

This can be achieved by a three traversal process:
1. Traversing the tree and then storing the deepest rightmost node in the tree.
2. We then find the node to be deleted and swap the values of the deepest node and the node to be deleted.
3. We the find the parent of the deepest rightmost node and replace the deepest rightmost node with null.
```java
class Solution
{
    public Node deletionBT(Node root, int key)
    {
        Node rightMost = null;
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<Node>();
        queue.add(root);
        while(!queue.isEmpty())
        {
            rightMost = queue.poll();
            if(rightMost.left != null)
            {
                queue.add(rightMost.left);
            }
            if(rightMost.right != null)
            {
                queue.add(rightMost.right);
            }
        }
        Node toDelete = null;

### Recursion in a tree
As a rule one may follow:
1. If recursion is to build the tree, follow a preOrder format, that is create the root first and then add children.
2. If recursion is to delete the nodes of a tree then follow the postOrder format that is delete the children first and ony then the parent.
3. If recursion is to neither build a tree nor delete nodes, but to replicate the structure of thee tree such as convert tree to linked list/ convert tree to array/ serializing a tree, always follow the preOrder format.

<a name ="TR_DeleteLeafNodes"></a>
### Delete leaf nodes with value as x
Given a binary tree and a target integer x, delete all the leaf nodes having value as x. Also, delete the newly formed leaves with the target value as x.

This question differs form the previous one in the manner that it is not just the leaf node that is to be deelted, but recursively all ndoes that satisfy the condition have to be deleted until no node satisfies the given condition. This introduces a new type of tree node deletion problems, where we need to delete nodes recursively until no remaining nodes satsify the deletion condition.

We solve such type of problems by following a post order traversal for deletion. The reason we follow a post order traversal is because it is necessary to delete the child elements of a node first before considering the removal of the node. If we follow a normal BFS traversal of the tree we would need to traverse the entire tree again and again for checking leaves, instead if we follow a post order traversal, if the leaves are deleted and we reach the root, the root automatically becomes the leaf and can be checked side by side.

The code is as follows:
```java
class Solution
{
    public static Node deleteLeafNodesX(Node root, int x)
    {
        return removeShortPathNodesUtil(root, x);
    }

    public static Node deleteLeafNodesXUtil(Node root, int x)
    {
        if(root == null)
        {
            return null;
        }
        root.left = deleteLeafNodesXUtil(root.left, x);
        root.right = deleteLeafNodesXUtil(root.right, x);
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null && root.data == x)
        {
            return null;
        }
        return root;
    }
}

### Remove nodes on root to leaf paths of length < K
Given a Binary Tree and a number k, remove all nodes that lie only on root to leaf path(s) of length smaller than k. If a node X lies on multiple root-to-leaf paths and if any of the paths has path length >= k, then X is not deleted from Binary Tree. In other words a node is deleted if all paths going through it have lengths smaller than k.
```java
class Solution
{
    public static Node removeShortPathNodes(Node root, int k)
    {
        // Utility recursive function
        // Input is root, current level or root and
        // the minimum length needed
        return removeShortPathNodesUtil(root, 1, k);
    }

    public static Node removeShortPathNodesUtil(Node node, int cuurHeight, int k)
    {
        // If node is null so return null
        if (node == null)
        {
            return null;
        }
        // Set left child of node recursively
        // If left subtree satisfies the property needed
        // then left child will remain same else it will
        // be null
        // Increase height by 1 before calling recursive function
        node.left = removeShortPathNodesUtil(node.left, cuurHeight + 1, k);
        // Do same for right child
        node.right = removeShortPathNodesUtil(node.right, cuurHeight + 1, k);
        // If both children are null, so check if the current node itself
        // satisfies the condition or not
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null && cuurHeight < k)
        {
            // If not return null

### Remove all nodes which don’t lie in any path with sum>= k
Given a binary tree, a complete path is defined as a path from root to a leaf. The sum of all nodes on that path is defined as the sum of that path. Given a number K, you have to remove all nodes which don’t lie in any path with sum>=k. The question is similar to previous one and follows the same approach.
```java
class Solution
{
    public static Node removeLessSum(Node root, int sum)
    {
        return removeLessSumUtil(root, 0, sum);
    }

    public static Node removeLessSumUtil(Node root, int curr, int sum)
    {
        
        if(root == null)
        {
            return root;
        }
        root.left = removeLessSumUtil(root.left, curr + root.data, sum);
        root.right = removeLessSumUtil(root.right, curr + root.data, sum);
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null && root.data + curr < sum)
        {
            return null;
        }
        return root;
    }
    
    public static void print(Node root)

            print(root.right);  
        }  
    }

### Construct binary tree from array representation
Given an array that represents a tree in such a way that array indexes are values in tree nodes and array values give the parent node of that particular index (or node). The value of the root node index would always be -1 as there is no parent for root. Construct the standard linked representation of given Binary Tree from this given representation.

For exmaple for the array { 1, 5, 5, 2, 2, -1, 3 } the tree would look like:
```java
          5
        /  \
       1    2
      /    / \
     0    3   4
         /
        6 
```
We can solve this problem in a simple iterative manner. All we would need is to store the nodes that we create along the way. Lets say we have a map that stores the array index as key and the node for that index as the value for the hashmap key. Let us say the input array is called parent[].
1. Traverse the parent[] array element by element. For every index check if the map contains the index. If map does not contain the index 'i', then create node for 'i' and add it to the map. The node would have the value as i (Node n = new Node(i)). If map already contained index 'i' then move to next element.
2. If the parent[i] was -1, in that case make sure you also mark the root to be equal to map.get(i).
3. If the parent[i] was not -1, then search for the parent's index in the map. If the parent's index does not exist, so create the parent index's node and add the child element node to its left subchild. Else if the parent's index node exists already so check for a vacant child node and add the child element there.

The code is as follows:
```java
class Solution
{
    public static Node createTree(int[] parent)
    {
        int n = parent.length;
        Node root = null;
        HashMap<Integer, Node> hMap = new HashMap<Integer, Node>();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            Node newNode = null;
            if(!hMap.containsKey(i))
            {
                newNode = new Node(i);
                hMap.put(i, newNode);
            }
            else
            {
                newNode = hMap.get(i);
            }
            if(parent[i] == -1)
            {
                root = newNode;
            }
            else if(!hMap.containsKey(parent[i]))
            {
                Node p = new Node(parent[i]);
                p.left = newNode;
                hMap.put(parent[i], p);
            }
            else
            {
                Node p = hMap.get(parent[i]);
                if(p.left == null)
                {
                    p.left = newNode;
                }
                else
                {
                    p.right = newNode;
                }
            }
        }
        return root;
    }

    public static void inorder(Node root)
    {
        if (root != null)
        {
            inorder(root.left);
            System.out.print(root.data + " ");
            inorder(root.right);
        }
    }
}

class Node
{
    int data;
    Node left;
    Node right;

    public Node(int x)
    {
        data = x;
        left = null;
        right = null;
    }
}

### Convert a given tree to its sum tree
Given a Binary Tree where each node has positive and negative values. Convert this to a tree where each node contains the sum of the left and right sub trees in the original tree. The values of leaf nodes are changed to 0.

If original tree is:
```java
                  10
               /      \
             -2        6
           /   \      /  \ 
         8     -4    7    5
```
It would become:
```java
                 20=4-2+12+6
               /      \
           4=8-4     12=7+5
           /   \      /  \ 
         0      0    0    0
```
Note that once a child takes values from the sum of leaf nodes, its original value is still considered when calculating sum for parent node.

This is a very trivial question that can be solved recursively. For every node we store its orgiinal value and then update the value as sum of left and right subtrees. Then, the new value + original value are returned in further recursive calls. We basically follow a bottoms up building approach recursively. Steps:
1. Do a traversal of the given tree. In the traversal, store the old value of the current node.
2. Recursively call for left and right subtrees.
3. Change the value of current node as sum of the values returned by the recursive calls

The code is as follows:
```java
class Solution
{
    public void toSumTree(Node root)
    {
        sumTree(root);
    }
    
    public int sumTree(Node root)
    {
        if(root == null)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        int value = root.data;
        root.data = sumTree(root.left) + sumTree(root.right);
        return root.data + value; 
    }
}

### Convert a Binary Tree to DLL
We can covnert a binary tree to its DLL representation very easily. A DLL is a doubly linked list and a binary tree node can be represented as a DLL node by simply putting the DLL previous as binary tree's left and DLL's next as binary tree's right. This way a BTree can be converted into a DLL easily.
```java
             10
          /      \
         2        6
       /   \     /  \ 
      8     4   7    5
```
For the tree above converting it into a DLL ould have the following process.
1. First add root, 10.<br>
DLL: 10
2. Now, the left element is 2 and right is 6. So link them accordingly.<br>
DLL: 2 <--> 10 <--> 6
3. For, 2, we connect it to 8 and 4 recursively.<br>
DLL: 8 <--> 2 <--> 4 <--> 10 <--> 6
4. Repeat same process fro children of 6.<br>
DLL: 8 <--> 2 <--> 4 <--> 10 <--> 7 <--> 6 <--> 5

Looking deeper into the algorithm discussed, we can notice that simlpy getting the inorder traversal of the tree and then froming a DLL out of it would do trick. The code is trivial and hence not covered in detail.

### Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree
Given a binary tree (not a binary search tree) and two values say n1 and n2, write a program to find the least common ancestor.

If say only one of the elemments exist in the tree, in that case the lowest common ancestor would be the respective element itself.

We traverse the tree starting form the root and look for the given elements in the left and right subtrees recursively. The node which has one element in its right subtree and one in its left subtree is the LCA. If no such node exists then following three conditions might be possible:
1. Root is one of the elements. In this case, root is the answer.
2. Only one element is present. In this case, the element present is the answer.
3. None of the elements are present. In this case, the answer is null.
```java
class Solution
{
    public static Node lowestCommonAncestor(Node root, int n1, int n2)
    {
        // If given element is null so return null
        if(root == null)
        {
            return null;
        }
        // If the element matches either of the given inputs
        // return the element itself
        if(root.data == n1 || root.data == n2)
        {
            return root;
        }
        // If the elements are present in left subtree
        // the this value 'left' would hold a node
        // else the function call will return null
        Node left = lca(root.left, n1, n2);
        // If the elements are present in right subtree
        // the this value 'right' would hold a node
        // else the function call will return null
        Node right = lca(root.right, n1, n2);
        // If both left and right are not null
        // then this node is our answer as its
        // left and right subtrees have the values
        if(left != null && right != null)
        {
            return root;
        }
        // If only left is not null, then left is the
        // answer as only one element is present
        if(left != null)
        {
            return left;
        }
        // If only right is not null, then right is the
        // answer as only one element is present
        else
        {
            return right;
        }
    }
}

class Node
{
    int data;
    Node left;
    Node right;

    public Node(int x)
    {
        data = x;
        left = null;
        right = null;
    }
}
```

Another method to do this can be we find and store the path to both the nodes in the tree. If only one node is found the the other node automatically becomes the answer. Else, both the paths will initially have certain number of common elements. The element, just before the first different element is the LCA.

### Diameter of Binary Tree
The diameter of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between two leaves in the tree. Our task is to find the diameter given the root.

We can achieve this by simple recursive tree traversal by recursively checking at each node for the following:
1. Length of maximum path length in subtree rooted at node, such that node is necessarily included.
2. Diameter in left subtree of node.
3. Diameter in right subtree of node.

The diameter for the node would be the maximum of the above three options fo any node. We repeat this process recursively for all the nodes. To implement this algorithm we take the following steps:
1. Maintain a global variable as 'answer' that represents our diameter.
2. For any node on which we are, get the maximum path length including the node. This is equal to height of left subtree of node + height of right subtree of node + 1 for the node itself.
3. Now this maximum path might form the new largest diameter so we check for the maximum of current 'answer' and the new maxlegnth at given node. The max of the two form the new 'answer'.
4. The above steps are ventualy repeted in recursive calls, giving us the final diameter as the value of the variable 'answer'.
```java
class Solution
{
    static int ans = 0;
    public static int diameter(Node root)
    {
        ans = 0;
        getHeight(root);
        return ans;
    }
    
    public static int getHeight(Node root)
    {
        if(root == null)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        int left = getHeight(root.left);
        int right = getHeight(root.right);
        ans = Math.max(ans, left + right + 1);
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}
```

<a name ="TR_HeightTree"></a>
### Height of Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, find its height. Height of a binary tree with only the root element is 1. The code is very simple and similar to the previous problem of following the diameter. The height of any node will be equal to 1 + maximum of height of left subtree and height of right subtree.
```java
class Solution
{
    int height(Node root)
    {
        if(root == null)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        int left = height(root.left);
        int right = height(root.right);
        return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
    }
}

### Serialize and Deserialize a Binary Tree
Serialization means to store the structure of something in a format different and simpler than the structure itself. Here serialization of tree means converting it into an array format and deserialization would mean reconstructing the tree from the serialized array.

There are various scenarios that can be encoutered for serializing trees:
1. **If given Binary Tree is Complete Tree:** A Binary Tree is complete if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and all nodes of last level are as left as possible. In this case level order traversal is sufficient to store the tree. We know that the first node is root, next two nodes are nodes of next level, next four nodes are nodes of 2nd level and so on.
2. **If given Binary Tree is Full Tree:** A full binary tree is where every node has either 0 or 2 children. It is easy to serialize such trees as every internal node necessarily has 2 children. We can simply store preorder traversal of the tree with every null node being denoted by a special value, say -1. This way even when desrializing every time we would encounter -1 we would know we do not need to add a new node and move to the next element in order.
3. **If the tree is neither full nor complete:** To serialize the tree we can use both inorder and preorder traversals of the tree as we can build the tree back using the two. This method eventually requires O(2N) space and O(2N) complexity for both serialization and desrialization. We can speed this up by converting the preorder traversal of the tree to match the one as mentioned in point 2, that is that of a full tree. Every time we encounter a null node as the child of a node in our preorder traversal, we add '-1' to the preorder traversal answer. This way in a single iteration and approximately O(N) space we can store the serialized array and similarly in O(N) space and time we can covnert the arrray back into the tree as discussed in step two. The process is depicted in detail in the code below:
```java
class Solution
{
    // A pointer for the preOrder array used in
    // deserialization
    static int p = 0;

    // serialization function. Exactly same as the preOrder traversal
    // except for the line where we add '-1' for null nodes.
    public static ArrayList<Integer> serializeTree(Node root)
    {
        ArrayList<Integer> ans = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        Stack<Node> stack = new Stack<Node>();
        Node curr = root;
        while(curr != null || !stack.isEmpty())
        {
            // The node curr is not null here
            while(curr != null)
            {
                ans.add(curr.data);
                stack.push(curr);
                curr = curr.left;
            }
            // When we reach this point we know now we have either traversed
            // to a null node, or the node curr was originally null itself
            // and never entered into the above while loop. In either of the
            // cases we would add '-1' to our preOrder traversal. We would do
            // this because if ndoe was not originally null, then this means
            // we have reached a null left child of some parent. And if the
            // node was already null then it means it was the null right child
            // of some parent.
            ans.add(-1);
            curr = stack.pop();
            curr = curr.right;
        }
        return ans;
    }

    // Input is the serialized preOrder array
    public static Node deserializeTree(ArrayList<Integer> arr)
    {
        // Set initial pointer of the preOrder array as 0.
        p = 0;
        return deserializeTree(arr);
    }

    // Input is the serialized preOrder array
    // Remember preOrder format is ROOT, LEFT, RIGHT
    public static Node deserializeTreeUtil(ArrayList<Integer> arr)
    {
        // If pointer has crossed array size or the pointer pointed to
        // a null node so we return null
        if(arr.size() <= p || arr.get(p) == -1)
        {
            // As it might be possible pointer points to a null node
            // and not necessarily has crossed the array length, so we
            // need to increase it for further iterations
            p++;
            return null;   
        }
        // Node root is initialized with value in the preOrder array
        Node root = new Node(arr.get(p));
        // Pointer is moved forward to next node
        p++;
        // We know that from preOrder fromat, the next node is left child
        // Now the pointer points to the next node in the preOrder array
        // and hence the desrialized left subtree would be added to root.left
        root.left = deserializeTree(arr);
        // When the above recursive call completes, the pointer would have
        // itself reached the point of the right child of the original node.
        // Hence we dont need to increase its value again.
        root.right = deserializeTree(arr);
        // Return the root, this return tree's root in case of first
        // call and the root's of subtrees in case of recursive calls.
        return root;
    }
}

class Node
{
    int data;
    Node left;
    Node right;

    public Node(int x)
    {
        data = x;
        left = null;
        right = null;
    }

### Symmetric Tree
Given a Binary Tree. Check whether it is Symmetric or not, i.e. whether the binary tree is a Mirror image of itself or not.

We simply need to iterate both the normal version and mirrored version of the tree together and check that whether or not nodes at every point are same. The code is easy to understand and hence detailed explanations of the workings have been opted out.
```java
class Solution
{
    public boolean isSymmetric(Node root)
    {
        // Add the root two times to the queue. We will
        // add nodes in such a saw as if we are traversing
        // the tree normalyl and its mirror side by side. 
        // Hence root is added twice as in both normal
        // and mirrored iteration, root comes first.
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<Node>();
        queue.add(root);
        queue.add(root);
        while (!queue.isEmpty())
        {
            // Get two heads
            Node t1 = queue.poll();
            Node t2 = queue.poll();
            // If both heads null so move to next
            if (t1 == null && t2 == null)
            {
                continue;
            }
            // If either one is null so return false
            // as not equal
            if (t1 == null || t2 == null)
            {
                return false;
            }
            // If values dont match so return false
            if (t1.val != t2.val)
            {
                return false;
            }
            // Now in normal iteration we would put first
            // head's left and hence in mirrored it's opposite
            // would be right of the other head.
            queue.add(t1.left);
            queue.add(t2.right);
            // Now when we put right of first head. its opposite
            // would be the left of second head.
            queue.add(t1.right);
            queue.add(t2.left);
        }
        return true;
    }
}

### Construct Binary Tree from String with bracket representation
Construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers. The whole input represents a binary tree. Output the tree in it's preorder form. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root’s value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure.

An example would be:
```java
Input : "4(2(3)(1))(6(5))"
Output : 4 2 3 1 6 5
Explanation :
           4
         /   \
        2     6
       / \   / 
      3   1 5   
```
We can solve this question recursively by building the root first and then recursively building the left and right child and repeating the process until all nodes have been created. The process is simple:
1. If string is empty, return null else the first number of string forms the root.
2. If the next character in string is '(' then that means root has a left child. Iterate the string to the point where you find a closing bracket for the original '('. This can be done easily using stack.<br>
Once the closing brackt has been found, call the recursive function again for the string between opening and closing brackets. The subtree formed would be the left subtree of the root.
3. If the next character in string is '(' after the last ')' for the left subtree, then that means root has a right child as well. Iterate the string to the point where you find a closing bracket for the original '(' of the right child. This can be done easily using stack.<br>
Once the closing brackt has been found, call the recursive function again for the string between opening and closing brackets. The subtree formed would be the right subtree of the root.
4. Once both the children have been checked, return the root.

NOTE: If the left child is null and right child is not null then representation is of the form rootNode()(leftChild). Instead, if right child is null and left is not null then empty brackets are not used, and is represented as rootNode(leftChild).
```java
class Solution

        }

        // Check if left child exists

### Construct String with bracket representation from Binary Tree
You need to construct a string consists of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversing way. The null node needs to be represented by empty parenthesis pair "()" if only left child is null and omitted if both children are null or if only the right child is null.
```java
       1
     /   \
    2     3
     \  
      4 

Output: "1(2()(4))(3)"
```
We follow the recursive process similar to the previous question:
1. If root is not null so add the root nodes data to the String 'main'.
2. If left and right child are null return main as answer.
3. Initialise String 'left' as "()" and String 'right' as "". The reason 'left' is not empty is because if right child is not null, we would need to represnt a null left child as "()".
3. Recursively check for right and left subtrees if they are not null.
4. Finally return 'main' + 'left' + 'right'.
```java
class Solution
{
    public String convertToBracketString(Node root)
    {
        return convertToBracketStringUtil(root);
    }

    public String convertToBracketStringUtil(Node root)
    {
        if(root == null)
        {
            return "";
        }
        String main = Integer.toString(root.data);
        String left = "()";
        String right = "";
        if(root.left == null && root.right == null)
        {
            return main;
        }
        if(root.left != null)
        {
            left = "(" + convertToBracketStringUtil(root.left) + ")";
        }
        if(root.right != null)
        {
            right = "(" + convertToBracketStringUtil(root.right) + ")";
        }
        return main + left + right;
    }
}

class Node
{
    int data;
    Node left;
    Node right;

    public Node(int x)
    {
        data = x;
        left = null;
        right = null;
    }

### Binary Search Tree
Binary Search Tree, is a node-based binary tree which has the following properties:
1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values lesser than the root's value.
2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the root's value.
3. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree. There must be no duplicate nodes.

The above properties of Binary Search Tree provide an ordering among keys so that the operations like search, minimum and maximum can be done fast. If there is no ordering, then we may have to compare every key to search a given key.

**Searching:**<br>
Searching in a BST is similar to binary search in an array. At every step we reduce the current search space to n/2. In a binary tree as we know elements are smaller in the left subtree and bigger in the right subtree, we can search accordingly.

**Insertion:**<br>
Insertion in a BST is modified version of searching. We basically search for the value we wish to insert and as soon as we reach a null node we insert the value at the position of the null node. We do this because while searching if we reach a null ndoe, that means, the value if present was expected to be at that position. Hence, we insert it there.

**Deletion:**<br>
Deletion in binary tree can have the following 4 cases:
1. <ins>The node to be deleted is leaf node</ins>: Simply make the leaf node null.
2. <ins>The node to be deleted has only one child</ins>: Replace the child with the node value. Delete the new child now, which is the original node.
3. <ins>The node has 2 children</ins>: In this case as the BST needs to be arranged in a particular manner that is left subtree should have smaller elements and right subtree should have greater elements, we replace the node with either the biggest element of the left subtree or the smallest element of the right subtree. And then delete the node from the new replaced position.
4. <ins>The node to be deleted does not exist</ins>: In this case the tree is returned as it is.
```java
class Solution
{
    public boolean search(int x, Node root)
    {
        if(root == null)
        {
            return false;
        }
        else if(root.data == x)
        {

### Construct BST from given pre-order traversal
Given preorder traversal of a binary search tree, construct the BST. To construct a binary tree from  given preOrder traversal, we can use a simple method based on the BST property of left subtree having values smaller than root and right subtree having values bigger than the root.

For any preOrder traversal we know that the first value is the root of the tree. So we use the first value of the preOrder to make the root. Now we know that further on, the values in left subtree will be in range from (-Infinity, root) and in right subtree will be from (root, +Infinity). So the next value that we get in preOrder would be the root of the leftsubtree or the right subtree depending on the range to which it belongs. This method can be used recursively to build the entire BST by modifying the range for the left and right subtrees of every node according to their respective root's values.

The process would be as follows:
1. Initialize the range as (-Infinity, +Infinity). Let us call this range (min, max). Maintain a global index preIndex for iterating the preOrder array.
2. The first value in preOrder definitely lies in this range and forms the root. Now, in preOrder as the format is ROOT LEFT RIGHT, we build the left subtree first followed by the right subtree.
3. Increment the golbal variable preIndex to point to the next element in preOrder and call the function recursively for the left subtree in range(min, root.data).
4. For the right subtree call the function in range (root.data, max). Remember, as the variable preIndex is globally defined, when the call for the left subtre finishes, preIndex automatically points to the right subtree's root and we need not increment it.
3. Repeat this process until preIndex >= preOrder array's size.
```java
class Solution
{
    int preIndex = 0;

    public Node constructBST(int[] preOrder)
    {
        return constructBSTUtil(preOrder, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE, preOrder.length);
    }

    public Node constructBSTUtil(int[] preOrder, int min, int max, int size)
    {
        if(preIndex >= size)
        {
            return null;
        }
        Node root = null;
        int val = preOrder[preIndex];
        if(val > min && val < max)
        {
            root = new Node(val);
            preIndex++;
            root.left = constructBSTUtil(preOrder, min, val, size);
            root.right = constructBSTUtil(preOrder, val, max, size);
        }

### Binary Tree to Binary Search Tree
Given a Binary Tree, convert it to a Binary Search Tree. The conversion must be done in such a way that keeps the original structure of Binary Tree.

To convert a binary tree to a binary search tree, we can first get the inOrder traversal of the binary tree and sort it. This sorted array would be the inorder traversal of the BST. Now we iterate the binary tree in inOrder fashion once again, and replace the values of the nodes according to the sorted array.
```java
class Solution
{
    public Node convertBTreeToBST(Node root)
    {
        // Inorder traversal of Binary Tree
        ArrayList<Integer> arrInOrder = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        Node node = root;
        Stack<Node> stack = new Stack<Node>();
        Node curr = node;
        while(curr != null || !stack.isEmpty())
        {
            while(curr != null)
            {
                stack.push(curr);
                curr = curr.left;
            }
            curr = stack.pop();
            arrInOrder.add(curr.data);
            curr = curr.right;
        }

        // Sort the inOrder array
        Collections.sort(arrInOrder);
        
        // Build tree again according to sorted array
        int index = 0;
        curr = root;
        stack = new Stack<Node>();
        while(curr != null || !stack.isEmpty())
        {
            while(curr != null)
            {
                stack.push(curr);
                curr = curr.left;
            }
            curr = stack.pop();
            curr.data = arrInOrder.get(index);
            index++;
            curr = curr.right;
        }

        return root;
    }

    public void inOrder(Node root)
    {
        if(root == null)
        {
            return;
        }

### Sorted linked list/array to BST
The process for both is similar. Find the middle element's index. This becomes the root. Recursively create left subtree and right subtree from the left and right half of list/array respectively. Note that the tree has to be a balanced tree that is the difference in height of the any two leaf nodes shoulbe be <= 1.

The code for linked list has been described below. For a linked list find the middle element is always O(N) and doing it repeatedly is time consuming. Hecne we make a time-space tradeoff and convert the linked list to an array in O(N) time and then use this array to build the BST.
```java
class Solution
{
    public Node convertLLToBST(LinkedListNode head)
    {
        // Convert LinkedList to ArrayList
        // This ArrayList as sorted would be the inOrder
        // traversal of the binary search tree
        ArrayList<Integer> arrInOrder = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        while(head != null)
        {
            arrInOrder.add(head.data);
            head = head.next;
        }

        // Convert this array into BST
        return convertLLToBSTUtil(arrInOrder, start, end);

    }

    public Node convertLLToBSTUtil(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int start, int end)
    {
        if(arr.size() == 0 || start > end)
        {
            return null;
        }
        int mid = start + (end-start)/2;
        int val = arr.get(mid);
        Node root = new Node(val);
        root.left = convertLLToBSTUtil(arr, start, mid-1);
        root.right = convertLLToBSTUtil(arr, mid + 1, end);
        return root;
    }

### Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Search Tree
Given values of two values n1 and n2 in a Binary Search Tree, find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). You may assume that both the values exist in the tree.

We recursively traverse the BST. If a node's value is greater than both n1 and n2 then our LCA lies in the left subtree of the node. If it's is smaller than both n1 and n2, then LCA lies in the right subtree. Otherwise, either the node is equal to either of n1 and n2 or the node has a value which is greater than one and lesser than one of n1 and n2. In both cases, the node itself is the LCA.

Note, the above algorithm assumes that the elements are always present in the BST. If the elements might or might not be present, the process is exactly same a sthe one for a normal binary tree.
```java
class Solution
{
    public Node LCAinBST(Node root, int x, int y)
    {
        if(root == null)
        {
            return null;
        }
        if(root.data > x && root.data > y)
        {
            return LCAinBST(root.left, x, y);
        }
        if(root.data < x && root.data < y)
        {
            return LCAinBST(root.right, x, y);

<a name="Graphs"></a>
## <p align="center"> Graphs </p>
A graph is a 2D data structure which consists of nodes and edges. The nodes are the vertices of the graph and the edges are the lines/path connecting these vertices. The nodes in can be classes in themselves, containting information more than simply a single vaue.

<a name ="GP_Representations"></a>
### Representing a graph
A graph maybe represented as an adjaceny list or as an adjacency matrix.

#### Adjacency Matrix
The adjacency matrix represtation of the graph represents the graph through a 2D matrix of the form int[][]. The matrix is of size V x V where V is the number of vertices. Each cell, (i,j) represents that whether a connection exists between the vertices i and j or not. The cell would be marked 1 if the edge is present and 0 if it is not present. For example, for the following adjacency matrix:
```java
   1  2  3  4
1 [0, 1, 0, 1]
2 [1, 0, 1, 0]
3 [0, 1, 0, 0]
4 [1, 0, 0, 0]
```
Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2, vertex 1 is also connected to vertex 4 and vertex 2 is connected to vertex 3.

An **undirected graph** is a graph where movement on every edge is allowed in both directions. The adjacency matrix for an undirected graph will always be symmetric if an edge exists between 1-2 then it aslo exists between 2-1. If the graph is **weighted**, that is there is a cost for every edge, the adjacency matrix, instead of keeping 1's and 0,s to denote presence or absence of edges, can instead use the weights of edges as entries to denote presence.

Adjacency matrix is used when the number of vertices are small and the task is related to identifying that whether or not an edge exists in a given graph. Seeing if an edge exists or not takes O(1) time.

#### Adjacency List
The adjacency list concept is different from the adjacency matrix in the way that it only stores the edges present in the graph, and does not have any storage to represent a non existent edge. For every node in the graph, we store a list of nodes it is connected to, eventually forming a list of lists. The outer list, also known as the parent list, represents the starting vertices, and the inner list at every index 'i' of the outer list, represesnts the nodes that the node 'i' is connected to. For example for the following adjacency list representation,
```java
[[2,4], [3], [], [1]]
```
Vertex 1 has an edge from 1 to 2, and from 1 to 4.<br>
Vertex 2 has an edge from 2 to 3.<br>
Vertex 3 does not have any outgoing edges.<br>
Vertex 4 has an edge from 4 to 1.<br>

An adjacency list is always a directed representation of the graph, hence for an undirected graph for any edge u-v, we would need a edge both from u to v and v to u. The graph is represtend like a ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, where adj.get(i) is list of nodes connected to node 'i'.

Most of the remaining concepts covered are based on the adjacency list representation of graphs and hence we look at how to build an adjacency list represtation from scratch:
```java
class Graph
{
    // Adjacency list which is list of list
    ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj = null;
    // Number of vertices
    int V = 0;
    
    // Initialise the graph
    public Graph(int v)
    {
        // Input the number of vertices
        V = v;
        // Initialise adj for those many vertices
        adj = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>();
        for(int i = 0; i < v; i++)
        {
            adj.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        }
    }
    
    // Add an edge from v to u
    public void addEdge(int v, int u)
    {
        adj.get(v).add(u);
        // For undirected graphs, add reverse edge too
        adj.get(u).add(v);
    }
}
```

### Breadth First Traversal
Breadth First Traversal(BFS) is a searching technique which helps you search through various nodes of a the graph, level by level. It works similar to how BFS works for trees. We begin with a starting node, root in case of trees, and then traverse all the nodes that can be reached from it directly and and add them in a queue. Then for all the nodes present in the queue we repeat the process, until the queue becomes empty.

**Why use a queue?**<br>
The aim of a BFS search is to first visit all direct children of the node and then proceed with each child seperately. This can be achieved by maintaining a queue which follows a First-In-First-Out order and hence only when the processing of parent nodes at the starting of the queue is completed, the subsequent children nodes are proccessed.

The difference between the BFS of a tree and that of a graph is that in graphs we need to maintain a visited array, to store the nodes which have been visited before. This is needed only in graphs and not in trees because unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles connecting children back to parents and without a visited array to keep track of already visited nodes, the search might end up in an infinite loop. The code for BFS is as following:
```java
class Graph
{
    // ASSUME WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING ALREADY AVAILABLE AN INITIALIZED
    // Adjacency list which is list of list
    ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj;
    // Number of vertices in the graph
    int V;
	
    // Breadth first traversal
	// Start is the node where we begin our BFS
    public void BFS(int start)
    {
        /*
        Construct a visted array to avoid infinite loops.
        Always remember to mark a node as visited as soon
        as you reach it.
        */
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        
        /*
        Construct a queue to store incoming
        vertices for further processing
        */
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        
        /*
        We begin by adding the starting node
        to the queue and process the queue
        till it becomes empty, that is all nodes
        have been exhausted.
        */
        queue.add(start);
        visited[start] = true;
        // st would store the node we are processing
		int st;
        
        /*
        The following loop runs till the queue becomes empty,
        that is till all of the nodes have been visted.
        */
        while(!queue.isEmpty())
        {
            // Remove the queue top, i.e. the node to be processed
            st = queue.poll();
            // Process the node as you like. Here we simply print it.
            System.out.println(st + " ");
            
            /*
            For all the nodes connected to 'st' add them
            to the queue so that they can be proccessed in
            the next iteration. Every node added to the queue
            necessarily needs it to be marked as visited. The
            adjacency list for node 'st' can be used to add
            the adjacent nodes of 'st' to queue.
            */
            for(int i = 0; i < adj.get(st).size(); i++)
            {
                int c = adj.get(st).get(i);
                // Check if node not already visited
                if(!visited[c])
                {
                    // Mark as visited and add to queue
                    visited[c] = true;
                    queue.add(c);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
The above code for BFS only works in the case when no disconnected components are present. **Disconnected components** of a graph exist, when the entire graph is not reachable from a vertex. For example, for the graph 1 -> 2 -> 3 and 4 -> 5 -> 6 are two disconnected components of the same graph and if we call BFS only on node 1 then we would never know about the existence of nodes 4,5 and 6. To tackle this problem, we modify our BFS function by making a wrapper function which calls our inner BFS function for every unvisited nodes yet. For this, we also need to move our visited array to the wrapper class and send it as an argument to the main BFS function as now we also need to check visited nodes outside the main BFS function to call BFS on remaining unvisited nodes. We add a BFS_Util function and modify the BFS function to accomodate these changes.
```java
class Graph
{
    // ASSUME WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING ALREADY AVAILABLE AN INITIALIZED
    ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj;
    int V;
    
    // Wrapper function for BFS
    public void BFS_Util()
    {
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        
        // For every node in the graph
        for(int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            // If node is unvisited only then call BFS
            if(!visited[i])
            {
                BFS(i, visited);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Breadth first traversal
    // We send the visited array as an argument so that we can check
    // for visited nodes inside the function
    public void BFS(int start, boolean[] visited)
    {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        queue.add(start);
        visited[start] = true;
        int st;
        while(!queue.isEmpty())
        {
            st = queue.poll();
            System.out.println(st);
            for(int i = 0; i < adj.get(st).size(); i++)
            {
                int c = adj.get(st).get(i);
                if(!visited[c])
                {
                    visited[c] = true;
                    queue.add(c);
                }
            }
        }
    }

### Depth First Traversal
DFS is also a searching algorithm which differs from BFS in the way that it searches for a node to the deepest level possible first, before moving on to searching in other children of the node. BFS searches all the children first and then proceeds to process each child seperately. DFS instead processes the children to the deepst level first, then recurses back to proceed to other children.

Just like BFS, we use a wrapper function with a visted array to accommodate for disconnected components of a graph.
```java
class Graph
{
    // ASSUME WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING ALREADY AVAILABLE AN INITIALIZED
    ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj;
    int V;
    
    // Wrapper function for DFS
    public void DFS_Util()
    {
        /*
        Construct a visted array to avoid infinite loops
        and to accomodate for disconnected components of
        the graph. Always remember to mark a node as
        visited as soon as you reach it.
        */
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[V];
        
        /*
        Call the DFS function for every unvisted node
        present in the graph
        */
        for(int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            if(!visited[i])
            {
                DFS(i, visited);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Depth first traversal
    public void DFS(int start, boolean[] visited)
    {
        /*
        We begin by marking the starting node as
        visited.
        */
        visited[start] = true;
        
        // Process the node as you like. Here we print.
        System.out.println(start);
        
        /*
        The following loop runs for all the children of
        the node. For every unvisited child, we run the DFS
        function on it, to reach the deepest level first
        before processing the other children. The adjacency
        list for node 'start' can be used for iteration.
        */
        for(int i = 0; i < adj.get(start).size(); i++)
        {
            int c = adj.get(start).get(i);
            if(!visited[c])
            {
                DFS(c, visited);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
***NOTE: A key point to remember can be that in DFS, the node is marked as visited when it has been reached and is being processed. On the other hand, in BFS, a node is marked as visited before it is processed, at the time of adding it to the queue itself, as once added to the queue, it is garaunteed that it will be processed.***

### Reverse a graph
Reversing a graph is simple. All you need to do is to create a new graph, where for every edge from u to v create an edge from v to u.
```java
class Graph
{
    // ASSUME WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING ALREADY AVAILABLE AN INITIALIZED
    ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj;
    int V;
    
    // Reverse a graph
    public Graph getReverse() 
    { 
        Graph g = new Graph(V);
        // For all vertices in the graph
		for (int v = 0; v < V; v++) 
        { 
            // Reverse all the vertices adjacent to this vertex 
            for(int i = 0; i < adj.get(v).size(); i++)
            {
                int c = adj.get(v).get(i);
                g.adj.get(c).add(v); 
            }
        } 
        return g; 
    }
}

### Connected Components in an undirected graph
Connected components are those subgraphs in which all vertices can be reached from every other vertex. To find connected componnets in an undirected graph is trivial and requires us to just simply perform a BFS/DFS traversal on the graph on every unvisted node, and every time a new BFS/DFS is performed, it outputs a new connceted component.
```java
// ASSUME WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING ALREADY AVAILABLE AN INITIALIZED
ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj;
int V;

boolean[] visited = new boolean[V];
for(int i = 0; i < V; i++)
{
    if(!visited[i])
    {
	    // Here either BFS or DFS is called and it gives us a new
		// connected component.
        DFS(i, visited);
    }
}

### Connected components in a directed graph - Kosaraju’s algorithm
A simple connected component for a directed graph is a subgraph in it where every vertex can be visited from every other vertex. Now, a **Strongly Connected Component(SCC)** is a <ins>maximal connected component</ins> which means that it is the <ins>largest possible connected component</ins> that can be made using the vertices in it. Hence, even if a single node is added to the SCC would result in making it not a connected anymore. This is because if adding a node would still have kept the subgraph as a connected component, then that means it was not the maximal connected component in the first place. Hencem for a SCC, adding even a sinle node to it would make result in making the graph not strongly connected.

The steps for the algorithm to identify all the SCCs of a directed graph would be as follows:<br>
**Step 1:** Run DFS on the graph and as and when every node is completed, add it to a stack. When we do this, the node that gets completed first, gets added to the stack first. Hence, the nodes that are completed late, that is the parent nodes are added after their children.<br>
<ins>Note</ins>: By a node getting completed we mean, DFS running for all its children.

**Step 2:** Now we reverse the graph. Reversing it results in the children now becoming parents and parents becoming children. This is done because now for the reversed graph, when we would run DFS on it one by one starting from the nodes that were completed last in the first step, every time a DFS run would get over, we would have found a new strongly connected component. This is because the group of nodes that are covered in the DFS iteration of the reversed graph point to the fact that there exists path from child to parent and parent to child both in the original graph within that group. 

**Step 3:** So once the graph is reversed, we run DFS one by one on the elements in the stack, till the stack becomes empty. We pop element from the stack and if it hasnt been visited yet, we run DFS on it. Every new DFS run, we generate a new SCC.

<ins>For example</ins>:<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="/Images/GP_SCC_1.png" width="300" height="200"/>
</div>
In the above graph, the three SCCs are marked in dotted circles. 4 and 5 cannot be put together as eventhough we can reach 5 from 4, we cannot reach 4 from 5. Now when we run DFS from a random vertex, say 2, the first vertex to be completed is 1, as 2 goes to 3, 3 goes to 1, 1 goes to 2 and 2 has already been visited so 1 is completed. Then 3 gets completed next, then 5, then 4 and then 2 at the end. Hence, the stack is:<br>
[1, 3, 5, 4, 2] with 2 at the top and 1 at the bottom.

Now if we reverse the graph we get the following:<br>
<div align="center">
<img src="/Images/GP_SCC_2.png" width="300" height="200"/>
</div>
Now on this reversed graph, when we run DFS on top of our stack, that is 2, we get the subgraph having {1,2,3} and the DFS ends. This is our first SCC. Next in stack is 4. When we run DFS on 4, we get {4} alone. This is our second SCC. Next we have 5 in the stack and our DFS yields {5}, which is our third SCC. Next we have 3 and then 1 but both of these have already been covered hence we do not run DFS on them. Finally we have three SCCs as asnwer:<br>
{1,2,3}, {4} and {5}.

The concepts needed for this question are DFS on graph, usage of stack and reversing a graph. As all of these concepts have been covered before, the code is trivial and hence not commented.

### Find mother vertex
A mother vertex is defined as the vertex in the graph from which all other vertices in the graph can be reached. There may exist more than one mother vertices, and the aim is to find any one of them. Three cases arise for the graph:
1. Disconnected graphs: No mother vertex exists
2. Connected undirected graphs: All vertices are mother vertices
3. Connected directed graphs: To be found

One method can be to perform BFS/DFS on all vertices one by one to check that from which can we reach all end points. Time compexity would be O(Num vertices x Time for DFS/BFS) = O(V(V+E)).

Another way to solve the problem can be using the concept similar to finding strongly connected components. We run DFS from a given node in the graph and store in a stack the last finished nodes. Hence, the top of the stack would point to the node that finishes last. The node that finishes last will necessarily have to be the mother vertex if one exists, as had it not been a mother vertex, so it would have acted as a sink during the DFS traversal and ended before the mother vertex.

Using this concept, to check the existence of a mother vertex, we run DFS with storing nodes in stack as and when each node is completed. The top of the stack is then checked to be the mother vertex. Thsi is done using DFS on the top node. If DFS travels to all nodes, then it is the mother vertex else mother vertex does not exist.

To check during DFS that all nodes have been visited or not, we can apply either of the following two methods:
1. As a visted aray is maintained, once nodes are visited they are marked as true. Hence after one iteration of DFS from the top node in the stack, break and check whether or not all nodes are visited. If yes then it is the mother vertex, else it is not.
2. As we already have a visited array which prevents us from visiting the same node once again, we can keep count of every time we reach a new node. When we reach a new node we do count++. This way if end count after DFS equals total number of vertices in the graph then the source of DFS is the mother vertex else it is not.

### Check if a directed graph is strongly connected
To check that whether a directed graph is strongly connected or not, we use the conecpt similar to Kosaraju's algorithm for finding all SCC. if we find all SCCs and the number of SCCs is just one, then the graph is strongly connected. But the task here is only different in the meaning that we need to confirm that whether a single SCC covers the entire graph or not and need not find more than one SCC. We can do this according to the following steps:
1. Mark all nodes unvisited.
2. Do DFS, if any node remains unvisited, then return false. This is because if we cannot reach all nodes from a given node then graph cannot be strongly connected.
3. If above step did not return false, so reverse the graph. Now on reversing the graph, if it is a strongly connected graph, a DFS should still cover all vertices.
4. Hence, again do DFS from the same node as the first time. If if any node remains unvisited now, then return false as eventhough that vertice could go to all nodes, not all nodes could reach that vertice.
5. If above step did not return false, so return true as now we know that there exists a vertice that can go to all nodes and all ndoes can go to that vertice too. Hence every vertice can go to every other one.

We can make the following observations from this and the previous three questions:
1. Connected components of an undirected graph can be found simply by doing a DFS on every unvisited node.
2. Strongly connected componenets are found by reversing the graph and doing DFS on the nodes that would be completed last in an original DFS. This way every DFS for a parent ends by forming a SCC for itself.
3. For checking if entire graph is SCC or not, first check if a single DFS reaches all nodes. If yes, so reverse the graph and once again repeat the DFS on the same node. If true both times so graph is a SCC.
4. Mother vertex can be found by checking reachability of a vertex to all others. Instead of repeating it for every vertex, find the topmost parent by running a DFS. Then run DFS on this node. If this node can reach all the other nodes in its DFS, then it is the mother vertex, else mother vertex does not exist.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
Use Case:
- Shortest distance from one source to all destinations
- Use if it is a weighted graph without negative weights

The algorithm for Dijkstra is a BFS inspired algorithm. Instead of a normal queue, we use a priority queue in dijkstra BFS which is sorted on the basis of distance from source. When we add a node to the queue, we add it along with it's current distance from the source as well. The current distance of a node can be calculated using the parent's distance from source and the distance between the parent and the node. The distance is updated based on the formula:<br>
Distance of node from source = Distance of parent from source + Distance of node from parent

Now when we run BFS, as the queue is sorted on basis of distance from the source, we always access the nearest node to soruce first. This nearest node cannot have a shorter distance than the current distance at which it is, as it has been calculated as a sum of shortest distances so far. The time complexity is ((E+V)logV) = ElogV.

The distances are stored in a dist[] array. During BFS, we update the distances of the nodes adjacent to the popped node on the basis of the distance of the popped node and add them to the priority queue. Once distance of all adjacent nodes of a popped node have been updated, the popped node is marked as complete. This can be done by maintaining a HashMap of completed nodes. Also note that unlike a normal BFS where we mark items visited while adding them to queue, here we mark them visited when removing them from queue, that is when we have finalized their shortest distance. The process continues till the priority queue becomes empty. At the end, the dist[] arr would hold the distance of each node from the source.

Moreover, if the path to any vertex from the source needs to be stored, we can maintain a parent[] array. The parent array will hold the parent node of every vertex, that is parent[i] holds the parent of i in its shortest path from source. To print the path, we may iterate the parent array until we hit the source starting from the target. For example, if we need path from source to target, then the path can be made as following:<br>
```java
// Source -> ... -> ... -> parent[parent[parent[Target]]] -> parent[parent[Target]] -> parent[Target] -> Target
```
The parent array is updated along with the distance array, that is everytime we find a newer shorter distance.

The steps of the algorithm would provide a better understanding of the functioning:
1. Start with the source, and add it to the prioirty queue. The distance of source from source is 0.
2. Now until the priority queue becomes empty, pop the head. If the head exists in the HashMap of completed elements, discard this element and move ahead. If it does not exist,  then use this popped node as source and also add it to the completed HashMap. This is done to ensure that once the distance of a node is finalized as mininimum, its distance does not change any further.
3. For the popped node, for every neighbour not already in the completed HashMap, check if the distance needs to be updated or not. Distance is updated only in the following condition hold true:<br>
Let popped node be 'p'<br>
Let neighbour be 'n'<br>
Let source be 's'<br>
Distance updated only if dist[n] < dist[p] + Distance between 'p' and 'n', that is only if current distance of 'n' from 's' is less than sum of distance of 'n' from 'p' and distance of 'p' from 's'.<br>
If the distance is updated then add this node to the priority queue. Moreover, as the distance has been updated, so this means that the shortest way to reach 'n' is now through 'p' and hence we update the parent array as follows:<br>
parent[n] = p;
4. Keep repeating the process until priority queue is empty. The final distance array would provide you with shortest distances and parent array would help in finding the path to a given vertex.

The code is as follows:
```java
class Graph
{
    // Distance and parent arrays
    int dist[];
    int parent[];
    // HashMap to store completed nodes
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> hMap;
    // Priority Queue for getting shortest distance Node
    PriorityQueue<Node> pQueue;
    int V;
    ArrayList<ArrayList<Node>> adj;

    public Graph(int v)
    {
        V = v;
        dist = new int[V];
        parent = new int[V];

        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            // Initial distances are marked as infinite
            dist[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            // Initial parents are -1
            parent[i] = -1;
            adj.add(new ArrayList<Node>());
        }
        hMap = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        // Priority queue sorted on the basis of distances
        pQueue = new PriorityQueue<Node>(new Comparison());
    }

    public void addEdge(int u, int v, int d)
    {
        // We add nodes along with the distance of the edge joining them
        adj.get(u).add(new Node(v, d));
        
        // For undirected graphs, add both directions
        adj.get(v).add(new Node(u, d));
    }
    
    // Code for dijkstra
    public void dijkstra(int src)
    {
        // Add source to pQueue
        pQueue.add(new Node(src, 0));
        
        // Mark distance of source as 0
        dist[src] = 0;
        while (!pQueue.isEmpty())
        {
            // Check if the head of the priority
            // queue is already completed or not.
            // If yes discard, else move ahead
            while (!pQueue.isEmpty() && hMap.containsKey(pQueue.peek().ind))
            {
                pQueue.poll();
            }
            if (pQueue.isEmpty())

**NOTE: As prioirity queue does not provide optimal time for deleting nodes, does it in O(N), hence we used a hashmap to check for duplicate values in the priority queue instead of removing the previously added distances from it.

### Bellman–Ford Algorithm
Use Case:
- Shortest distance from one source to all destinations
- Use when weighted graph with negative weights is present
- No negative weight cycles allowed
- Used to detect negative weight cycles
- Can also be used when only a certain number of edges are allowed in the shortest path

Dijkstra does not work in case of negative weights being present in the graph. In case of negative weights, we can use Bellman Ford Algorithm to get the shortest distance from a source to all vertices and check for the presence of a negative weight cycle.

<ins>Fact-1</ins>: In a graph having v vertices, the maximum non cyclic path length can be of length v-1. Any path of length greater than equal to v, will definitely form a cycle.

<ins>Fact-2</ins>: In case of a cycle consisting of poistive edges only, iterating the cycle again and again will increase the total path sum to infinite as the same positive edges are traversed again and again. On the other hand, in case of cycles having a negative weight sum, the cost of traversing the cycle can continue to keep on descreasing till negative infinite if we loop the cycle again and again.

Using the above two facts we can visualize an algorithm, that builds all shortest paths possible from the source, with lengths of paths varrying from 1 to v-1. While building paths, for paths of all varrying lengths, we update shortest diatances in the distance array accordingly. When paths of length upto v-1 have been created, at this point we can be assured that the distacne array contains shortest distances of all nodes from the source. We then check once again for an even shorter path if possible. If there is still a shorter path length possible, then a negative weight cycle exists in the graph, else no negative weight cycle and the shortest paths calculated are correct.

**<ins>Step 1</ins>:** Initialise distance and parent arrays.

**<ins>Step 2</ins>:** We start finding shortest distances for paths of length 1 to paths of length v - 1. Therefore, for v-1 times, for all the edges present in the graph, for each edge we check that for the edge u - > v, is it possible to get a distance smaller than current dist[v]. That is, dist[v] < dist[u] + length of u-v. If yes, so we update dist[v] and parent[v] as well.<br>
```java
// for v-1 times
//     for every edge in graph
//         if dist[v] < dist[u] + length of u-v
//             update dist[v] and parent[v]
```
***The reason this step is done v-1 times:***<br>
_Initially when all distances are infinite, the first iteration would confirm the shortest distances of paths of length 1 from source. In the second iteration, as paths of length 1 had already been finalized, so now paths of length 2 would be finalized, that is nodes which are just a single edge away from previously finalized nodes. Building up like this, in v-1 iterations, we can be sure that all non cyclic paths have been finalized to be the shortest possible paths._

**<ins>Step 3</ins>:** Once paths have been finalized, run a final loop over all edges once again, checking that is it still possible to get a smaller path sum than the already finalized values. If true, that means that there is a negative weight cycle present, else there is no negative weight cycle and the path lengths finalized so far are correct.

Time complexity is O(EV).

Code:
```java
class Graph 
{
    // The graph is built be adding edges

                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

### Floyd Warshall Algorithm
Use Case:
- Shortest distance between all pairs of vertices
- A weighted graph with negative weights is allowed too

The task is to compute the shortest distances between every pair of vertices in the graph. The graph is directed and may contain negative weights as well. We calculate this using dp. The task is that for every vertice k, we calculate shortest path between i and j such that k is a vertex in the path. Hence, the steps would look like:
```
For every vertex k from 0 to (v-1)
    For every vertex i from 0 to (v-1)
        For every vertex j from 0 to (v-1)
            dist(i,j) = Math.min(dist(i,k) + dist(k,j))
```
Distance and parents are stored in a way similar to Dijkstra and Bellman Ford.
The input graph should be taken as an adjacency matrix, graph[][], where graph[i][j] = INF if an edge doesn't exist between i and j. Time complexity is O(V^3).

The code for the algorithm is as follows:
```java
public void floydWarshall(int graph[][]) 
{ 
    int dist[][] = new int[V][V];
    int parent[][] = new int[V][V];
    /*
    Initialize the solution matrix same as input graph matrix.
    This is because initial values of shortest distances are
    based on shortest paths with no intermediate vertex.
    */
    for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
    {
        for (j = 0; j < V; j++)
        {
            dist[i][j] = graph[i][j]; // Assuming graph[i][j] is infinity in case of no path
            parent[i][j] = -1;
        }
    }
    
    // Intermediate vertices loop
    for (k = 0; k < V; k++)
    {
        // Source vertices loop
        for (i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            // Destination vertices loop
            for (j = 0; j < V; j++)
            {
                if (dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j])
                {
                    dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j];
                    parent[i][j] = k;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

### Shortest path in an unweighted graph
Use case:
- Shortest path from one source to all destinations
- Unweighted graph, can be cyclic/acyclic both

The idea is to use a modified version of BFS instead of Dijkstra. As we do not have any weights attatched, the BFS can run in O(V + E) time as a priority queue won't be needed. The remaining basic steps are simialr to Dijkstra for storing and updating distances and parents.

The code is as follows:
```java
class Graph
{
    // Distance and parent arrays
    int dist[];
    int parent[];
    int V;
    ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj;

    public Graph(int v)
    {
        V = v;
        dist = new int[V];
        parent = new int[V];
        adj = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>();
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            // Initial distances are marked as infinite
            dist[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            // Initial parents are -1
            parent[i] = -1;
            adj.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        }
    }

    public void addEdge(int u, int v)
    {
        adj.get(u).add(v);
        
        // Only for undirected graph
        // adj.get(v).add(u);
    }
    
    // Code for BFS
    public void BFS(int src)
    {
        // Add source to Queue
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[V];
        
        // Mark distance of source as 0
        dist[src] = 0;
        // Add source to queue
        queue.add(src);
        // Mark soruce as visisted
        visited[src] = true;
        // Arbitrary node
        int node = 0;
        while (!queue.isEmpty())
        {
            // Get the head of the queue
            node = queue.poll();
            
            // For all adjacent nodes
            for (int i = 0; i < adj.get(node).size(); i++)

                    // Update dist, parent and visited
                    dist[c_ind] = dist[node] + 1;
                    parent[c_ind] = node;
                    visited[c_ind] = true;

### Topological Sorting
Topological sorting for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge from u to v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering, that is it is a method of listing nodes of a graph such that all parents are listed before their children. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

<div align="center">
<img src="/Images/GP_TopoSort_1.png" width="300" height="200"/>
</div>

For the above image, a valid topological sort output would be: 1 2 3 4 5 6

Topological Sorting is mainly used for scheduling jobs from the given dependencies among jobs. This means that for example lets say job A needs job B to be finsihed first and job C needs job A to be finsished first so a topological sort of dependencies would print B A C, meaning that complete job B first, then A then C.

Topological sort can be easily implemented using DFS. In DFS, we process a vertex and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. In topological sorting, we need to process a vertex only after its adjacent vertices have been processed. Hence, the only change in DFS needed would be to store a node after DFS has been called for its adjacent nodes. The complexity is the same as DFS, that is O(E+V).

We achieve this by maintaining a stack and one by one add vertices to the stack when they have been completed. The child nodes will obviously be completed before and added to the stack first. This way, all child vertices are added to stack before the parent vertex. Hence, when actually printing the stack by poppoing elements, the parents would be printed first followed by the children.

The code is as follows:
```java
class Graph
{
    // Number of vertices
    int V = 0;
    // Adjaceny ist
    ArrayList<ArrayList<<Integer>> adj = null;

    public Graph(int v)
    {
        V = v;
        adj = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>();
        for(int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            adj.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        }
    }

    public void addEdge(int u, int v)
    {
        // As it is TopoSort, graph is necessarily directed
        adj.get(u).add(v);
    }

    public void topoSort_Util()
    {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[V];

        for(int i = 0; i < v; i++)
        {
            if(!visited[i])
            {
                topoSort(stack, visited, i);
            }
        }

        // Print stack for topoSort
        while(!stack.isEmpty())
        {
            System.out.println(stack.pop());
        }
    }

    public void topoSort(Stack<Integer> stack, boolean[] visited, int s)
    {
        visited[s] = true;
        for(int i = 0; i < adj.get(s).size(); i++)
        {
            int c = adj.get(s).get(i);
            if(!visited[c])
            {
                topoSort(stack, visited, c);
            }
        }
        // Add node to stack only when all adjacent nodes have
        // been processed
        stack.push(s);
    }
}

The shortest path in a DAG can be easily found using topological sort. We know that topological sort will give us an ordering where parents are necessarily placed before children. So after topological sort, any DAG is converted into the form of a linear ordering like A -> B -> C -> D.

In such an ordering of say n elements, 1 -> 2 -> .. k .. -> n-1 -> n, if we have the source as say 'k', we would know that all elements, from 1 to (k-1) will be at a distance of infinity from 'k' as they would not be reachable from it, because they are the parent nodes. Furthermore, now when moving from k to k+1 and so on till n, we can keep updating minimum distances of nodes reachable from our current node.

A run through of the algorithm at every step would look like:

<div align="center">
<img src="/Images/GP_ShortestPathDAG_1.png" width="520" height="200"/>
</div>

**Step 0:** The original graph is as seen in picture (a). Let us say we have to find shortest distances to all nodes from s.

**Step 1:** Now after running the topological sort the graph can be arranged as seen in picture (b). It shows which nodes can be reached from where. For example, it is guaranteed that 'r' cannot be reached from 's', as it comes before 's' in the topological sort. The distance of the source 's' from itself is marked as 0 and all the other distances are currently +INF. 

<div align="center">
<img src="/Images/GP_ShortestPathDAG_2.png" width="800" height="550"/>
</div>

**Step 2:** From pitcure (c) onwards, we start updating distances from the top of our stack. In (c) we update distances for adjacent nodes of 'r'. As node 'r' is itself at +INF, we do not update distances of its adjacent nodes as it cannot be reached from 's'. In the stack generated from the topological sort, we keep on popping elements and updating distances of their neighbours if the element that was popped is not at infinite distance. So next as seen in (d) we pop 's' from the stack of topoligcal sort and update shortest distances of its neighbours. Repeat the process for 't', 'x', 'y' and 'z' in pictures (e), (f), (g) and (h) respectively.

**Result:** Now as we can see in picture (h), the shortest distances of all nodes from s has been successfully marked.

The code would be as follows:
```java
class Graph
{
    // Number of vertices
    int V = 0;
    // Adjaceny ist
    ArrayList<ArrayList<Node>> adj = null;
    // Stack for TopoSort
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<Integer>();
    // Distance array
    int[] distance = null;

    public Graph(int v)
    {
        V = v;
        adj = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Node>>();
        distance = new int[V];
        for(int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            distance[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            adj.add(new ArrayList<Node>());
        }
    }

    public void addEdge(int u, int v, int d)

            {
                topoSort(visited, i);
            }
        }
    }

    public void topoSort(boolean[] visited, int s)
    {
        visited[s] = true;
        for(int i = 0; i < adj.get(s).size(); i++)
        {
            Node c = adj.get(s).get(i);
            if(!visited[c.ind])
            {

            }
        }
        // Add node to stack only when all adjacent nodes have
        // been processed
        stack.push(s);
    }

    // Function for shortest path in toposorted graph
	// Assumption: Toposort has already been called
    public void calculateShortestPath(int src)
    {
        // Update distance of source
        distance[src] = 0;
        // From head of stack
        while(!stack.isEmpty())
        {
            // Get head
            int c = stack.pop();
            // If head is not at infinite distance from source
            // The first element would be the source itself to
            // satisfy the condition
            if(distance[c] != Integer.MAX_VALUE)
            {
                // For all adjacent vertices of head
                for(int i = 0; i < adj.get(c).size(); i++)
                {
                    // Update minimum distance for those nodes
                    Node inner = adj.get(c).get(i);
                    distance[inner.ind] = Math.min(distance[inner.ind], distance[c] + inner.dis);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

// Class node for graph

    int ind = 0;
    int dis = 0;

    public Node(int i, int d)
    {
        ind = i;

### Graph coloring - Chromatic Number
Graph coloring is a technique in which you are needed to color the vertices of a graph in such a way that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. The minimum number of colors needed to achieve this is called the chromatic number of the graph. The basic greedy algorithm to know that how many colors would be needed to color the graph would be:<br>
**Step 0:** Make 2 arrays to sotre colors. One array will sotre the color used for each index. Let us call this array color_matching[]. The other array would hold boolean values denoting whether a color is available to use at any moment of time or not. Let us call this array colors[].

**Step 1:** Color the first vertex with the first available color. To check the first available color, simply loop through the colors[] array and check for availablity. Add this color to color_mathcing[] for the first vertex.

**Step 2:** Now for every other vertex we do the following:
1. Mark all the colors as available intitially.
2. For every adjacent node of the vertex, mark the colors used by adjacent nodes as not available anymore. 
3. Now search for the first available color in the colors[] array and use it for this node. Add this color to color_mathcing[] for this vertex.

The code would be as follows:
```java
class Graph
{
    // Coloring holds the color for all nodes
    int[] coloring;
    // Colors holds list of all available colors
    boolean[] colors;
    int V;
    ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj;

    public Graph(int v)
    {
        V = v;
        coloring = new int[V];
        colors = new boolean[V];
        adj = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>();
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            // Initial colors assigned are none
            coloring[i] = -1;
            adj.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        }
    }

    public void addEdge(int u, int v)
    {
        adj.get(u).add(v);
        // Only for undirected graph
        adj.get(v).add(u);
    }
    
    // Code for coloring
    public void applyColoring()
    {
        // Mark first node with 0 color
        coloring[0] = 0;
        
        // For all other nodes
        for(int i = 1; i < V; i++)
        {
            // Make all colors available initially
            Arrays.fill(colors, true);
            
            // For all adjacent vertices of current node
            for (int j = 0; j < adj.get(i).size(); j++)
            {
                // Get index value of adjacent vertex
                int c_ind = adj.get(i).get(j);
                // If index has been colored before
                if(coloring[c_ind] != -1)
                {
                    // Mark color as unavailable
                    colors[coloring[c_ind]] = false;
                }
            }
            
            // For all colors in colors list
            for(int j = 0; j < V; j++)
            {
                // If color is available
                if(colors[j])
                {
                    // Use this color
                    coloring[i] = j;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
A very common application of coloring can be when similar people/items have to be sought into different groups. For example, course scheduling such that courses with common students do not have classes at the same time, or exam scheduling, or where people are to be divided into two groups on the basis of people liking/hating each other and so on. The process is to connect the related items together and then try to color the graph with different adjacent colors.

We may also use it to check if a graph is bipartite or not. If graph is 2 colorable it is bipartite. To check whether a graph is m-colorable or not we use the conecpt in the next section.

### m-Coloring Problem
The m coloring problem is similar to finding the number of colors needed to color a graph. The difference being that instead of telling how many colors are needed, the task it to tell that whether or not a valid coloring can be achieved using m colors. The question asks you to tell whether or not a graph can be colored using m colors at most such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. If yes, then also output the coloring selected.

We can apply a simple standard backtracking approach here, that is:
1. Assign the smallest numbered color available to a node such that it doesn't clash with colors of neighbours
2. If with the above color selection for the current node, the remaining graph can be properly colored as well, then return true as we have found a perfect color matching. Otherwise if the remaining graph cannot be colored properly, then backtrack and retry with a different available color for the node in step 1. When all options have been exhausted without a suitable permutation to color the entire graph, return false.

The code is as follows:
```java
class Graph
{
    // Coloring holds the color for all nodes
    int[] coloring;
    int V;
    ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj;

    public Graph(int v)
    {
        V = v;
        coloring = new int[V];
        colors = new boolean[V];
        adj = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>();
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            // Initial colors assigned are none
            coloring[i] = -1;
            adj.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        }
    }

    public void addEdge(int u, int v)
    {
        adj.get(u).add(v);
        // Only for undirected graph
        adj.get(v).add(u);
    }
    
    // Code for coloring
    public boolean applyColoring_Util(int v, int m)
    {
        // If have completed the last node
        if(v == V)
        {
            return true;
        }
        // For all colors avaialable
        for(int i = 0; i < m; i++)
        {
            // Check if color can be used, that is
            // not has been used by neibours
            boolean check = true;
            for(int j = 0; j < adj.get(v).size(); j++)
            {
                // Check with neighbours color
                if(coloring[adj.get(v).get(j)] == i)
                {
                    check = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            // If no neighbours use this color
            if(check)
            {
                // Assign this color to v
                coloring[v] = i;
                // If with this coloring graph completes
                if(applyColoring_Util(v+1, m))
                {
                    return true;
                }
                // If coloring fails, remove color
                coloring[v] = -1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

### Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree
Given a connected and undirected graph, a **spanning tree** of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree(does not have any cycles) and connects all the vertices together(therefore there are V-1 edges). There can be multiple spanning trees for a single graph. A **Minimum Spanning Tree(MST)** for a <ins>weighted, connected and undirected graph</ins> is a spanning tree with edge weight sum less than or equal to the edge weight sum of every other spanning tree. The edge weight sum of a spanning tree is defined as the sum of weights of all edges included in the spanning tree. A MST  will always have V-1 edges.

The algorithm for calculating the MST is exactly similar to how we calculate the shortest path using djikstra. The steps are:
**Step 1:** Pick a source vertex and create a HashSet to store the finalized vertices and a priority queue sorted on the basis of distance from the source to store upcoming vertices.

**Step 2:** For the source vertex, select all adjacent vertices which are not already present in the HashSet and update their distances. Check if the distance of these vertices from the source needs to be updated or not.<br>
Distance of a vertex = Math.min(Distance of vertex, Distance of parent from source + Distance of vertex from parent)<br>
Add the vertices with updated shortest distances from source in the priority queue.

**Step 3:** Repeat step 2 until either the queue becomes empty or the HashSet size is equal to V, that is all nodes have been covered.

**Step 4:** During step 2, make sure to maintain a distance and parent array to store the final information regarding distances between two nodes in MST and the parent-child connections for the tree, just like we do in Dijkstra.

An important point to note will be that this algorithm specifically works for undirected graphs and not for directed graphs. The reason is that for an undirected graph, running Dijkstra just once will not only result in shortest distances from the selected source to other vertices but from them to the source itself as well. This is because movement is allowed in both ways in an undirected graph. Hence, a MST is generated by a single run of Dijkstra. On the other hand for a directed graph, we would have to run Dijkstra for all the nodes as sources sperately. As the code is exactly like Dijkstra, it is not covered here and can be seen from <a href="#GP_Dijkstra">here</a>.

### Minimum cost to connect all cities
The question is to find the minimum cost of connecting all cities with roads such that every city is reachable form every other city. This is a very straight forward application of a MST and can easily be implemented using the Dijkstra algorithm as discussed above in Prim's MST section. Also as the task is to not only find the MST but calculate the minimum cost as well, once our parent array is ready, we need to add the weight of every edge in the MST to find the asnwer.

As the topics for Prims MST and Dijkstra have been covered before, we directly move to the code without further explanations. To get an understanding of how these topics are coded, refer to the sections covered above.

### Disjoint Union Find - Rank and Path Compression
Disjoint data structures are data structures which are used to store things in groups. We can easily create groupings for various items and then use our find and union methods on these groupings to check whether two items are in the same group or not and to put two groups together respectively.

We use a method called find by path compression and union by rank. Please visit the following two links first, before reading the code provided:
1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/union-find/

### Detect a cycle in a directed graph
Detecting a cycle in a directed graph is easy. All it requires you to do is to check that whether or not in a single run of DFS from parent to child, a loop is formed. Remember that a cycle exists if and only if in the same run from child to parent an already visited node is found. For example:

<div align="center">
<img src="/Images/GP_CycleDirected_1.png" width="150" height="300"/>
</div>

In the above graph, when the DFS first runs for 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 and then for 1 -> 3 -> 5, it would actually see the node 5 as already have been visited in the first DFS run but it would still not count it as a cycle as for detecting a cycle we are required to refresh/renew the visited array for every new iteration of the DFS. WeNext, when we exit the node after completing DFS for it, we mark it as not visited again.

The code is as follows:
```java
class Graph
{
    int V;
    ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj;
    // HashSet helps us save time by avoiding checking for same nodes
    // again and again. If a node has been checked once and did not
    // return a cycle in previous DFS itersations it would not produce
    // a cycle now either. So to check nodes that have been completed
    // before we maintain a hashSet as the visited[] array would be 
    // refreshed every new iteration and hence cannot be used for this.
    HashSet<Integer> hashSet;
    
    public Graph(int v)
    {
        V = v;
        adj = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>();
        for(int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            adj.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        }
        hashSet = new HashSet<Integer>();
    }
    
    public void addEdge(int u, int v)
    {
        adj.get(u).add(v);
    }
    
    public boolean DFS_Util()
    {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[V];
        for(int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            // If node not already completed
            if(!hashSet.contains(i))
            {
                // If there is a cycle in this DFS run itself 
                if(DFS(i, visited))
                {
                    // Return true
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        // If no cycles were found so return false
        return false;
    }
    
    public boolean DFS(int src, boolean[] visited)
    {
        // If node has been covered before, therefore this node would
        // not create a cycle. This is because if it would have created
        // a cycle it would have return true already before reaching
        // this point again.
        if(hashSet.contains(src))
        {
            return false;
        }
        // Mark node as visited for this DFS run.
        visited[src] = true;
        // For all adjacent nodes
        for(int i = 0; i < adj.get(src).size(); i++)
        {
            int c = adj.get(src).get(i);
            // If node was visited in the same run earlier then a
            // cycle has been detected. Return true.
            if(visited[c])
            {
                return true;
            }
            // If a cycle is detected further ahead in the children of
            // this ndoe then also return true
            else if(DFS(c, visited))
            {
                return true;
            }
        }
        // Once all adjacent nodes have been comepleted and none of them
        // returned a cycle so you can mark this node as completed.
        hashSet.add(src);
        // Mark the node as unvisited as it may be a part of some other
        // DFS iteration as well.
        visited[src] = false;
        // Return false as no cycles detected
        return false;
    }

### Detect a cycle in an undirected graph
Detecting a cycle in an undirected graph is trickier than doing it for a directed graph. Remember, that in undirected graphs, edges are always added in both directions, hence for every child node you will always find the parent as already visited and hence the direct method of finding an already visited node would not work. Rather the exact fact that a parent is always visited is utilized, in such a way that if we find a visited node other than the parent, we return true.

The code is as follows:
```java
class Graph
{
    int V;
    ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj;

    public Graph(int v)
    {
        V = v;
        adj = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>();
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            adj.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        }
    }

    public void addEdge(int u, int v)
    {
        adj.get(u).add(v);
        adj.get(v).add(u);
    }
    
    // Code for checking Cycle
    public boolean checkCycle()
    {
        // Visited array
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[V];
        for(int i = 0, i < V; i++)
        {
            // If node is not visisted
            if(!visited[i])
            {
                // Check for cycle
                // Send parent value as -1 for head vertex
                if(checkCycleUtil(visited, i, -1))
                {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    public boolean checkCycleUtil(boolean[] visited, int i, int u)
    {
        // Mark ith node as visited
        // u is the parent of ith node
        visited[i] = true;
        // For all adjacent vertices of i
        for(int j = 0; j < adj.get(i).size(); j++)
        {
            int c = adj.get(i).get(j);
            // If adjacent vertex not visited
            if(!visited[c])
            {
                // Check for cycle further
                if(checkCycleUtil(visited, c, i))
                {
                    return true;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                // If visited so make sure not parent
                if(c != u)
                {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;

<a name="GP_CountAllSourceDestination"></a>
### Count all paths from source to destination in a graph
Counting all paths between two vertices is a backtracking problem on graphs. The methodoly is to follow the DFS pattern to reach the destination vertex, and every time you reach the destination, increase the count of number of ways.

Please note that this method works only for graphs which do not have cycles. If a graph has a cycle then infinite number of paths can be formed from source to destination as the cycle can be looped around infinite number of times.

The code is as follows:
```java
class Graph
{
    // ASSUME INITIALIZATION CODE OF GRAPH CLASS REMAINS UNCHANGED
    
    // Consider a global variable count to maintain count of paths
    int count = 0;
    
    // The wrapper function to call the recursive function
    public int countAll(int s, int d)
    {
        countAll_Util(int s, int d);
        return count;
    }
    
    // Recursive function to count paths
    public void countAll_Util(int start, int dest)
    {
        // If current node meets the destination
        // Then increase count
        if(start == dest)
        {
            count++;
        }
        else
        {
            // For all the adjacent nodes of the current node
            // Call the recursive function again
            for(int i = 0; i < adj.get(start).size(); i++)
            {
                countAll_Util(adj.get(start).get(i), dest);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
For a graph containing a cycle, a modification can be that count all the paths to reach the destination, such that in a path, a node is encountered at most once. In this scenario, even after the presence of cycles, the question can be solved by maintaining a simple visited array to check when a node has been visited in a path. We illustrate this concept through the next question.

<a href="#Contents">Back to contents</a>

<a name="GP_PrintAllSourceDestination"></a>
### Print all paths from source to destination in a graph
Please complete the above section first and then proceed with this. We use the same DFS inspired algortihm to print the paths as well, by possibly storing all the paths in a List. Moreover, we consider that the graph may contain cycles, hence, we have a limit that the same node cannot be visited twice in any path. The code would be as follows:
```java
class Graph
{
    // ASSUME PREVIOUS CODE OF GRAPH CLASS REMAINS UNCHANGED
    
    // The wrapper function to call the recursive function
    public List<List<Integer>> countAll(int s, int d)
    {
        // The list that will hold the final asnwer
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // A boolean visited list to check nodes visited in a path
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[V];
        
        // The new ArrayList<Integer>() is the list for each
        // individual path
        countAll_Util(int s, int d, ans, new ArrayList<Integer>(), visited);
        return ans;
    }
    
    // Recursive function to store paths
    public void countAll_Util(int start, int dest, List<List<Integer>> ans, ArrayList<Integer> arr, boolean[] visited)
    {
        /*
        Mark the current node as visited and add it to the
        current path so far.
        */
        visited[start] = true;
        arr.add(start);
        
        // If current node meets the destination
        // then add the arr to ans
        if(start == dest)
        {
            ans.add(new ArrayList<>(arr));
        }
        else
        {
            /*
            For all the adjacent nodes of the current node
            which have not been visited yet, call the function
            on them again.
            */
            for(int i = 0; i < adj.get(start).size(); i++)
            {
                if(!visited[adj.get(start).get(i)])
                {
                    countAll_Util(adj.get(start).get(i), dest);
                }
            }
        }
        /*
        Mark the current node as not visited and remove
        it from the current path so far. This is done because
        now the current node has been completed and all the paths
        from this node have already been added to the asnwer.
        */
        visited[start] = false;
        arr.remove(arr.size() - 1);
    }
}

### Minimum steps to reach target by Knight
The question statement is as follows:<br>
Given a M x N board, a position at which a Knight(Chess piece) has been placed. Find the minimum number of steps the Knight need to reach a given destination.

This problem can be consdiered as a variation of the shortest path in an unweighted graph. The only difference would be, that instead of actually having adjacent nodes as an input in the graph, we would need to calculate them ourselves according to the rules of chess for a Knight's movement. Hence, the only movements allowed will be two steps up,down,right or left and then then one step perpendicular to it.

Running the BFS with these movements in mind, as we traverse level by level. At all times, the nodes on a level so far will have covered the same distance from the source. Hence, as soon as the destination is reached for the first time, the distance so far to the destination will be minimum and our search can end. The code is as follows:
```java
/*
Create a class cell to identify the position
of a cell and the distance from the source
*/
class cell
{
    int x;
    int y;
    int dis;
    
    public cell(int X, int Y, int Dis)
    {
        x = X;
        y = Y;
        dis = Dis;
    } 
}

<a name="GP_MinSwapsToSort"></a>
### Minimum swaps required to sort an array
The question requires you to find the minimum number of swaps needed to sort a given array. We use the process of cyclic swapping here.

**<ins>Example 1</ins>:**<br>
Original Array:<br>
7 1 0 5 4<br>
Sorted Array:<br>
0 1 4 5 7

<div align="left">
<img src="/Images/GP_MinSwapsToSort_1.png" width="250" height="80"/>
</div>

We can notice that the minimum number of swaps needed would be 2. We may swap 7-4 and then 4-0, or we may swap 0-4 and then 7-0 or we may swap 7-0 and then 7-4. In all three possibilities, the maximum number of swaps needed is 2. To put this visualization on pen and paper, we can see the in the actual sorted array, the following connections are needed:
1. Element at index 0, goes to element at index 4.
2. Element at index 4, goes to element at index 2.
3. Element at index 2, goes to element at index 0.

***This forms a cycle of swaps. It can be noticed that in a cycle of swaps of length k, the actual number of swaps needed will always be k-1, because as the swaps are cyclic, the last swap would have been performed in within the previous k-1 swaps.***

**<ins>Example 2</ins>:**<br>
Original Array:<br>
2 4 3 1 8 5<br>
Sorted Array:<br>
1 2 3 4 5 8

<div align="left">
<img src="/Images/GP_MinSwapsToSort_2.png" width="275" height="150"/>
</div>

Cycle 1:
1. Element at index 0, goes to element at index 1.
2. Element at index 1, goes to element at index 3.
3. Element at index 3, goes to element at index 0.

Cycle 2:
1. Element at index 2, goes to element at index 2.

Cycle 3:
1. Element at index 4, goes to element at index 5.
2. Element at index 5, goes to element at index 4.

Hence there are three cycles, which make (3-1) + (1-1) + (2-1) total swaps, that is 3 total swaps are needed. To apply this idea we create a graph between the indexes where the elements are currently and the index where they should be at. And then calculate the summation of (cycle lengths - 1). The code is as follows:
```java
class Solution
{
    // The input is an array of length N
    public int minSwaps(int[] arr, int N)
    {
        // Construct a Graph, usign class similar to one learned above
        Graph g = new Graph(N);
        // HashMap is used to store the original indexes of the values
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hMap = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        {
            // Add (element, original index) to HashMap
            hMap.put(arr[i], i);

        Arrays.sort(arr);
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        {
            // Add an edge between the correct index and original index of an element.
            g.addEdge(i, hMap.get(arr[i]));
        }
        // Call the function to get the value of min swaps.
        return g.minSwapsNeeded();

            c++;
        }
        // Return cycle length
        return c;
    }
}
```
_**NOTE:** We do not use the recursive DFS method to check cycle length as here it is possible that all the nodes might come under a single DFS call resulting in a stack overflow error. In general, the stack can sustain upto a maximum of 10000 recursive calls. Hence as we need to access only a single child here, we use the while loop instead of recursive calls._

### Minimum operations needed to convert x into y
The question requires you to convert a given number x into y in minimum steps possible and then report the count. You would be allowed only a certain number of operations. For example, lets say convert x into y, with operations allowed:
1. Multiply number by 2
2. Subtract 1 from number

In this scenario, the question becoems similar to the knight problem. The source and destination are knows with movements allowed only to numbers (a x 2) and (a - 1) if you are at 'a' currently. Hence, we use a BFS approach to calculate the minimum count. The code would be as follows:
```java
/*
Class value to hold the number and distance
*/
class cell
{
    int x;
    int dis;
    
    public cell(int X, int Dis)
    {
        x = X;
        dis = Dis;
    } 
} 

class Solution
{
    // Main method
    public int minStepToReachTarget(int start, int dest, int N)
    {
        // The BFS queue
        Queue<cell> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        // The visited hash map to avoid visiting the same number in loops
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> visited = new hashMap<Integer, Integer>(); 

        /*
        Add the starting cell to queue and mark it visited
        The starting cells is (start) with a distance
        of 0 from the source.
        */
        queue.add(new cell(start, 0));
        visited.add(start, start);

        // Arbitrary node to be accessed inside loop
        Cell node = null;
        // Run loop till queue has elements
        while (!queue.isEmpty())
        {
            // Get topmost element from queue
            node = queue.poll();
            // If this is destination so return distance
            if (node.x == dest)
            {
                return node.dis;
            }
            
            // Add all possible non visited destinations to queue
            int next_1 = node.x * 2;
            int next_2 = node.x - 1;
            if (!visited.containsKey(next_1))
            {
                // Mark as visited
                visited.add(next_1, next_1);
                /*
                Add to queue. The new distance will be the distance of
                current element that is the node, plus 1.
                */
                queue.add(new cell(next_1, node.dis + 1));
            }
            if (!visited.containsKey(next_2))
            {
                // Mark as visited
                visited.add(next_2, next_2);
                /*
                Add to queue. The new distance will be the distance of
                current element that is the node, plus 1.
                */
                queue.add(new cell(next_2, node.dis + 1));
            }
        }
        return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    }
}

### Minimum cost path with Left, Right, Bottom and Up moves allowed
The question is a modification of the min cost path in grid where movements allowed were bottom and right. Now all 4 directional movements are allowed. Hence, we cannot use DP here. Instead, we have following options:
1. If the graph is unweighted, that one cell means cost of 1 then we use BFS to search for target and as soon as we find the target we return.
2. If the graph is weighted, we can check if it has negative weights or not. If not, use Dijkstra.
3. If graph is weighted and has negative weights, we may choose to use Bellman Ford.

For our question, let us assume that the conditions for Dijkstra are satisfactory. So in order to build our solution as the input is a grid and not a graph, we modify our algorithm to accomodate for this variation. In grid questions, requiring graph algorithms, we build a new class to represent the cell in a grid as a vertex in the graph. We generally need not build the entire graph using this new class, rather as and when the next cell of grid needs to be accessed, we build a new object of our class with required values. A demonstration can be seen in the following implementation for this question, where the class cell represents the cell in the grid, with x cordinate, y cordinate and the distance of the cell from source thus far.
```java

    public static int calculateShortestPath(int[][] cost, int src_x, int src_y, int dest_x, int dest_y, int n, int m)

            {
                distance[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            }
        } 
        // Visited/Completed array
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[n][m];
        // PriorityQueue for our djikstra
        PriorityQueue<Cell> pQueue = new PriorityQueue<Cell>(new Comparison());
        // Add source
        pQueue.add(new Cell(src_x, src_y, cost[src_x][src_y]));
        // Distacne of source is 0
        distance[src_x][src_y] = cost[src_x][src_y];
        // Till priority queue becomes empty

**NOTE:** Also, instead of checking for every possible move seperately, we could have made x and y arrays for all the moves possible and then checked them in a loop. It would be similar to what we did in the <a href="#GP_KnightProblem">Knight Problem</a> question above for the 8 available moves of a Knight.

### Number of triangles in a graph
The task is to find the number of traingles in a directed/undirected graph. It is simple to do so by taking all pairs of three vertices present in the graph and checking them for forming triangles. This can be achieved simply through a triple for loop consdiering every triplet of vertices present.
```java
For int i (0 to V)
    For int j (0 to V)
        For int k (0 to V)
            Check if (i,j,k) forms a triangle
```
Now, the other task is to actually count a triangle only once. In both directed and undirected graphs, multiple triangles can be formed using the same set of triplets.

<div align="center">
<img src="/Images/GP_NumTriangles_1.png" width="200" height="200"/>
</div>

In undirected graphs, every triangle will be counted 6 times, like say triangle name is ABC, so it will be counted as:
1. ABC
2. ACB
3. BCA
4. BAC
5. CBA
6. CAB

<div align="center">
<img src="/Images/GP_NumTriangles_2.png" width="200" height="200"/>
</div>

In directed graphs, a triangle say ABC, will be counted only three times as it has the following variations because of the fixed direction of edges:
1. ABC
2. BCA
3. CAB

Hence, the final count in case of undirected graph is (Total number of triangles)/6 and that for directed graphs is (Total number of triangles)/3.
```java
class Graph
{
    int V;
    // HashSet helps us save time when all that is required is to just check that
    // whether or not an edge exists from a given starting vertex to an ending
    // vertex. 
    // We could have alternatively used an adjacency matrix as well for this purpose.
    ArrayList<HashSet<Integer>> adj;
    
    public Graph(int v)
    {
        V = v;
        adj = new ArrayList<HashSet<Integer>>();
        for(int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            adj.add(new HashSet<Integer>());
        }
    }
    
    public void addEdge(int u, int v)
    {
        adj.get(u).add(v);
        // Bidirectional edges for undirected graphs only
        adj.get(v).add(u);
    }
    
    public int countTriangles()
    {
        int count = 0;
        // For first vertex of triangle - A
        for(int i = 0; i < V; i++)
        {
            // For second vertex of triangle - B
            for(int j = 0; j < V; j++)
            {
                // For third vertex of triangle - C
                for(int k = 0; k < V; k++)
                {
                    // Check if the edges AB, BC and AC can be formed or not
                    // That is check if i-j, j-k and k-1 can be formed or not
                    if(adj.get(i).contains(j) && adj.get(j).contains(k) && adj.get(k).contains(i))
                    {
                        // If yes so new triangle found
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        // If undirected so return count/6
        // If directed so return count/3
        return count/6;
    }
}

### Minimize Cash Flow among a given set of friends
The questions statement is that "Given a number of friends who have to give or take some amount of money from one another. Design an algorithm by which the total cash flow among all the friends is minimized."

We can approach the question by thinking about money lending among friends. For example in the image below, we see how a 3-transaction graph cpuld be more efficiently converted to a 2-trnsaction graph.

<div align="center">
<img src="/Images/GP_MinCashFlow_1.png" width="200" height="200"/>
<img src="/Images/GP_MinCashFlow_2.png" width="200" height="200"/>
</div>

We can develop a greedy approach for this question based on the following few facts:<br>
**Fact 1:**<br>
Among the group of friends, there will always be a person with maximum profit and one with minimum profit, which means that, if we were to calculate the net profit for everyone after all transactions are done, there will always be someone with maximum amount of money earned and someone with maximum amount of money spent. For example in the case above, the friend who gets the maximum amount of money is P2, who gets 7000. And the friend who pays net maximum amount of money is P1, who paid 4000, that is had a -ve profit. This disparity is always and always bound to exist because if at all it wasnt the case and everyone was supposed to end up with the same net profit, then no transactions would have been needed at all as the net profit for everyone would be the same.

**Fact 2:**<br>
As seen from fact 1, if the net profits for everyone is same, it means that the transaction has settled. Now further building up upon this fact, we can notice, that for this scenario to arise, that is, for net profits to be same, the only valid net profit value is 0. This is because, let us say if net profit for everyone is +10, then that means no one is loosing money, and hence there definitely would not be any way possible for everyone to make a profit of +10. This is because for a transaction to take place, there necessarily has to be the same amont of money spent as the amount of money earned. Similarly, if the net profit was say -10 for everyone, this would again be invalid as everyone is loosing money, so that money has to go somewhere or to someone who makes a net +ve profit but that isn't the case either. Hence, we can conclude that the only way for everyone to have the same net profit is for their net profits to be 0.

**Fact 3:**<br>
Building further from the concept of fact 2, we can also conclude that if all net profits are not 0, then there will be necesasrily be atleast one negative and one positive net profit. This is because if we assume all profits to be net positive, say +100, +50 and +30, once again, we can notice that there is no one who is spending the money and hence these transactions could not take place. Similarly, because of the same reason, all net transactions cannot be negative either. For example if we have the following situation:

<div align="center">
<img src="/Images/GP_MinCashFlow_3.png" width="200" height="200"/>
</div>

The net profit for 1 is as of now +100, and for 2 is +50. Now in order to make the net profit of 3 as any positive value, any change that we would make would necessarily result in atleast one of 1 and 2 having a net negative value.

**Fact 4:**<br>
To reduce the number of transactions in such a way that we have to be guaranteed that atleast one person would be out of the cash flow process after every transaction, the best possible way out is to select the two candidates according to fact 1, that is one who is supposed to end with maximum profit(will necessarily be +ve), and one who is supposed to end with minimum proift(will necessarily be -ve). We select these two people, and transfer the minimum of (MaxProfit, -MinProfit) from person with maximum debt to person with maximum profit. The reason we write -MinProfit instead of simply MinProfit is because as we saw in fact 3, MinProfit would necessarily be negative, and hence to check for the magnitude of MinProfit vs MaxProfit we need to make it postivie. We would refer MaxDebt as -MinProfit ahead. Now after this transaction from person in debt to person in profit, either of the two would have been removed from the remaining transactions. For exmaple if the MaxDebt was more than the MaxProfit, then we transfer MaxProfit amount from person in debt to person in profit, and now the person in profit need not participate in further transactions as his account is settled. Similarly, if say MaxProfit to be earned was more than MaxDebt to be payed, then we pay the amount equal to MaxDebt from person in debt to person supposed to get the profit. This way the person in debt would not need to participate in further transactions as his account is now settled to 0.

Using these 4 facts we develop the following greedy algorithm:
1. Maintain a list at all times having the current new profits of people. The maximum of this list is the MaxProfit and the minimum of this list is the MaxDebt. _Always remember that MaxDebt would be <= to 0 and that MaxProfit would be >= 0.
2. Pay Math.min(MaxProfit, MaxDebt) from guy with MaxDebt to guy with MaxProfit. Update the remaining balance for both the people.
3. Repeat the process until we reach the scenario where both MaxProfit and MaxDebt are 0, that is all transactions have been settled.

### Rotting oranges
The questions is as follows:
In a given grid, each cell can have one of the following three values:
1. The value 0 representing an empty cell.
2. The value 1 representing a fresh orange.
3. The value 2 representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten. Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1 instead. For example:

<div align="center">
<img src="/Images/GP_RottingOranges_1.png" width="840" height="200"/>
</div>

**Input: [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]**<br>
For the input in the above format, we can see that originally we would be at minute 0. Every minute, if there is a fresh orange in a cell above, below, left or right to any rotten orange, then that orange also becomes rotten. All we need to do is to check the time it would take to rot all oranges.

The question can be seen as a modification of the shortest distance in unweighted graph problem. The reason this is considered an unweighted graph is because the cost of moving to a moveable cell is always 1, that is 1 unit of time. The algorithm is very straight forward where we keep the following in mind while writing our BFS function:
1. Initially, we can move from a rotten orange cell, that is cell with value 2, to a non-rotten orange cell only, that is cells with value 1. These movements can take place without any waiting time as we are moving from cells which already had rotten oranges in them. The situation can be considered as if a 0-weight edge connects the cells.
2. When we reach a cell with a non-rotten orange, before moving to adjacent non-rotten orange cells, we have to wait a minute for it to rot first. This waiting time can be visualized as an edge of distance 1 between the two adjacent cells.
3. No movements are allowed to empty cells.

Hence the modification that we make to our BFS call would be that in case we encounter a cell with value 0, we do not proceed any further, and in case we encounter a cell with value 1, we plus the distance so far(time taken to rot) by 1.

The code is as follows:
```java
class Solution
{
    public int orangesRotting(int[][] grid)
    {
        int count = 0;
        int n = grid.length;
        int m = grid[0].length;
        // Visited array to avoid visiting same cells again
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[n][m];
        // Queue to maintain set of next cells to be visited
        // As it is unweighted graph, we need not maintain a Priority Queue
        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<Node>();
        // We would need to know the following before beginning our BFS loop:
        // 1. The nodes from where to begin the BFS. These would be all nodes
        // with rotten oranges already present in the initial graph.
        // 2. The number of nodes we need to convert, to check that whether or
        // not we have met our target conversions.
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 0; j < m; j++)
            {
                // Check for number of oranges to be rotten

### Accounts Merge - Find similar contacts in list
The question gives us a list of lists. Each list in the main list, is of the following format:<br>
<Name, Email-1, Email-2 .... Email-n><br>
Note: The number of values in each inner list might varry, the only constant is atleast one email ID and necessarily the name.<br>

The task is that given such a list of list, merge all contacts having common Email-IDS and output a joined list with merged contacts. In the list of merged contacts for every inner list, make sure the emails are in lexographically sorted order.<br>
Note: Two people with the same name might not necessarily have the same emails, but two people with same emails will necessarily have the same names.

Refer to https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/ for better question description.

We can solve this problem using the union find algorithm. As we are required to merge similar contacts together, union find using path compression and find by rank seems a perfect fit over here. Now, we shall see the requirements for the DSU union find algorithm:
1. We should be able to define individual subsets, preferably using integers.
2. The task should involving either merging the subsets together or checking for existence of elements in already merged subsets.

The second requirement is met as seen in the question description, that we need to combine similar contacts together. For the first requirement, we can modify the input taken. For every email ID that we read, we can assign a unique ID to each new Email using a hashMap. So instead of forming subsets of emails as strings, we can denote each email uniquely through an integer. We then would be needed to combine IDs of the same person together.

So now let us look at the final algorithm:
1. For the input, create two hashmaps.
	- <ins>Email to Name</ins>: Maps the email to the name of the person. Do not need to check for overlapping insertions, as if the same email repeats, from the qeustion description we know the same name will be used necessarily.
	- <ins>Email to ID</ins>: ID here is an integer ID. Maps email to integer ID. This is needed so that we can use these IDs in our DSU instead strings. Ensure not to overwrite already included emails, as an ID assigned to an email once should remain the same.
2. Now, for every email in the same list, that is for every email belonging to the same person in the initial list, we call union on the first Email for that person and all the others. This way, say a person has 5 emails, two in one list and three in another, in which there is one common one. So we get the following scenario:<br>
	- For 1st list of the person, EMail-A and Email-B are unioned forming a set -> [A, B]
	- For the 2nd list, lets say Email-A is common and others are Email-C and Email-D. So now when Email-C is unioned with A it forms the set [A,B,C] and similarly union with D forms [A, B, C, D]. So using this process, we are able to form a union set of all emails belonging to same contact combined together.
3. Create a new HashMap for our answer which will have the unique ID assigned to an email as the key, and the value would be the list of all emails that belong to the set of that ID in the DSU. Now for every email in our second hashmap(Email to ID), using the unique ID of every mail and find the set to which that Email belongs to and add it to the respective set in the final asnwer HashMap.
4. Once done with the above step we now have a HashMap with different sets of Emails as values. TO produce the final answer we need to add the names of the owners to those sets. For this purpose we use the first email of every list to find the name of the owner of the emails in that list, using our frist hashmap(Email to Name) and add the name to their respective email lists.

Here is the code:
```java
class Solution
{
    public List<List<String>> accountsMerge(List<List<String>> accounts)
    {
        HashMap<String, Integer> emailToID = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
        HashMap<String, String> emailToName = new HashMap<String, String>();
        int id = 0;
        int n = accounts.size();
        DSU dsu = new DSU(10000);
        for(List<String> personList : accounts)
        {
            String personName = personList.get(0);
            for(int i = 1; i < personList.size(); i++)
            {
                String eMail = personList.get(i);
                emailToName.put(eMail, personName);
                if(!emailToID.containsKey(eMail))
                {
                    emailToID.put(eMail, id);
                    id++;
                }

            }

            if(ans.containsKey(id2))
            {
                ans.get(id2).add(eMail);
            }
            else

                ans.put(id2, new ArrayList<String>());

### Knight's tour problem - Visit each cell in a grid atleast once
The problem asks you to check that is it possible that a Knight placed on a board of size N x N, cover all the cells on the board, visiting each cell atmost once. Printing the board would be benefetial to confirm the answer.

This can be solved easily using backtracking. The idea is to use a DFS based approach in backtracking. For every cell we are own we try all the possibilities till we get the corect final answer. If a possibility is wrong we reverse back and change the possibility. If the cell we are on runs out of possibilities we directly return false.

The algorithm is the basic backtracking approach that from the starting cell (0,0) we try to move in all possible valid Knight movement directions and increase the total cell's filled count by 1. We then repeat the process, until we reach the totoal count to be N x N (positive base case, that is where we return true) or if we run out of options for a particular cell (negative base case, that is where we return false). The code is as follows:
```java

        int[] di_y = { 1, -1, 1, -1, 2, -2, 2, -2};
        board[0][0] = 1;
        if(KnightsTourUtil(board, 0, 0, di_x, di_y, 1, N))

### Rat in a maze - All 4 directions movement allowed
Rat in a Maze - I problem is very basic. It is exactly similar to the DP problem involving a grid with some obstacles and you are needed to find the minimum cost path from the top left to the bottom right of the grid. That problem is covered in the section <a href="#DP_2DimensionalGrids">DP for 2D grids</a>.

We tackle an advanced version of the problem here. We say that movement is allowed in all four directions Up(U), Down(D), Left(L) and Right(R). The gird has certain cells that can be visited marked by 1 and certain cells that are blocked, marked by 0. The task is to output a sorted list of all possible paths to reach the bottom right of the grid from the top left.

Instead of using dynamic programming, we need a graph based backtracking soltion here. Reasons:
1. <ins>Why not dynamic programming?</ins><br>
Because dynamic programming depends on previously computed values, and for movements in 4 directions, previous values would not be available.
2. <ins>Why graphs?</ins><br>
If we imagine the grid as a graph where all the visitable cells are connected with edges and the cells he ce form the nodes, the question becomes similar to a graph traversal that to find a path to reach a given node from a source. This is a very typical DFS problem. We apply DFS on the source cell, have 4 adjacent cells(U, D, L and R) and then for each reachable adjacent cell we recurse til lwe reach the final answer and find a path.
3. <ins>Why backtracking?</ins><br>
As we are needed to find all paths till the destination, we do not stop at finding the first path, which is what the DFS normally does, that as soon as we reach the target, we stop. Instead, when we reach the end, we add the current path to answer and then recurse/travel back to the previous node and try the next available option and check if a new path can be formed. This way after every path found, until newer options are available to traverse we keep on looking for more.

<ins>A trick to print the path in sorted order</ins>:<br>
One straight forward method would be to first create a list of all valid paths and then sort the list. This would take O(NlogN) time more than the time already taken to create the list. A way faster and smarter method would be to create the list in the sorted manner in the first place. We know that every string in the asnwer list would have only 4 characters which are 'D', 'U', 'L' and 'R'. To create the answer in a sorted manner, at every cell when we check our options to move to different adjoining cells, we search are options in the alphabetical order that is, 'D', 'L', 'R, and then 'U'. This way the answer is automatically generated in a sortd manner from the beginning itself.
```java
class Solution
{
    public static ArrayList<String> printPath(int[][] m, int n)
    {
        // Answer list
        ArrayList<String> ans = new ArrayList<String>();
        // If first or the last cell themselves are non reachable
        if(m[0][0] == 0 || m[n-1][n-1] == 0)
        {

### Count all paths with exactly/upto k edges in a graph
**<ins>For count of paths with exactly K edges</ins>:**<br>
The question states that in a given graph/grid, count all the paths with exactly k edges from a given source to a destination. The approach one might immediately think of is backtracking. Yes, the question is solvable using backtracking but with an exponential complexity of O(V^k).

Instead, we may choose to use dynamic programming. Using a 3D array, the dynamic programming solution becomes very easy and intuitive. As we need paths of length k, we use a bottom up manner to build our table, where we start from counting paths of length 0 and move on to paths of length k.
```java
// The dp array will be of the form [Source][Destination][NumEdges] storing the count
// of total paths from 'Source' vertex to 'Destination' vertex with 'NumEdges' edges

// For number of edges 'e' in the path (from 0 to k)
//   For every vertex 'u' marking start of the path (from 0 to V)
//     For every vertex 'v' marking the end of the path (from 0 to V)
//       For every vertex 'a' adjacent to starting source 'u' (from 0 to V)
//         Num paths from 'u' to 'v' with 'e' edges += Num paths from 'a' to 'v' with 'e-1' edges

// The above algorithm works because for any given pair of vertices say u-v, where u is the starting point and
// v is the ending point, let us say we need all paths between u and v of length k. So now, if we have already
// calculated all paths of length k-1, we can simply find all adajcent vertices of u, which are at a distance 1
// from u and then check that whether or not a path of length k-1 exists from these adjacent vertices to the
// destination v. As we have already calculated the count for k-1 edges paths, so the number of paths of length
// k-1 that go from an adajcent vertex of u to v, are the same as the number of paths of length k which go from
// u to v.
```
The time complexity for the above method is O(V^3 x k). This is significantly faster than the backtracking solution. The code has been commented for further explanation.
```java
class Solution 
{
    // Function to calculate and return count
    // Input is graph[][], source u, destination v, edges k, vertices v
    public int countwalks(int graph[][], int u, int v, int k, int V)
    {
        // DP array to store [Source][Destination][NumEdges]
        int count[][][] = new int[V][V][k+1];
        // For number of edges ranging from 0 to k
        for (int e = 0; e <= k; e++)
        {
            // For source from 0 to V-1
            for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)
            {
                // For destination from 0 to V-1
                for (int j = 0; j < V; j++)
                {
                    // If number of edges is 0
                    // Then path exists if source = destination
                    if (e == 0 && i == j)
                    {
                        count[i][j][e] = 1;
                    }
                    // If number of edges is 1
                    // Then path exists only if a direct edge exists
                    if (e == 1 && graph[i][j]!=0)
                    {
                        count[i][j][e] = 1;
                    }
                    // If number of edges is more than 1
                    if (e > 1)
                    {
                        // For all vertices from 0 to V-1
                        for (int a = 0; a < V; a++)
                        {
                            // Check adjacent vertice of i by checking for edge
                            // If edge exists from i to a
                            if (graph[i][a]!=0)
                            {
                                // New count of paths from i to j is
                                // Old count + Count of paths from a to j using
                                // 1 less edge
                                // Hence,
                                // count(i,j,e) = count(i,j,e) + count(a,j,e-1)
                                count[i][j][e] += count[a][j][e-1];
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        // return count from vertex u to vertex v with k edges
        return count[u][v][k];
    }
}
```
**<ins>For count of paths with upto K edges</ins>:**<br>
The working of the algorithm remains the same with the only difference being that instead of returning just the answer of exactly k edges we return the sum for count of paths with 0, 1, 2, .... , k-2, k-1, k edges, that is count[u][v][0] + count[u][v][1]  + count[u][v][2] + ... + count[u][v][k-1] +  + count[u][v][k].

### Shortest path with exactly/upto k edges in a graph
**<ins>For shortest path with upto K edges</ins>:**<br>
Given a graph, our task is to find the shortest path in that graph from a source to a destination with atmost k edges used in the path.

We can apply the Bellman Ford algorithm here to get the shortest path of length upto k edges. Revisit Bellman Ford algorithm <a href="#GP_BellmanFord">here</a>. So now using the concept of Bellman Ford, rather than building paths of length upto maximum V-1, we instead build paths of length maximum K. So our outer loop goes from 1 -> K, instead of 1 -> V-1.

        // [Starting, ending, distance]
        // [u, v, d]
        int[][] edges =  {  { 0, 1, 1 },
        { 0, 2, 1 },

        {
            dist[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }
        // Source is at 0 distance
        dist[src] = 0;
        // For the number of edges allowed
        for(int i = 1; i <= k; i++)
        {
            // The new distance array for the updated
            // path with at most i edges allowed
            int[] newDist = new int[n];
            // Carryforward vales with previous number of
            // edges allowed as it might be possible that
            // minimum distance may be formed with less than

            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++)
            {
                newDist[j] = dist[j];
            }
            // So at this point both newDist and dist hold the
            // same values, but eventualy we update newDist to
            // hold shortest distances of upto length i and dist
            // would hold distances of length upto i-1.

            // For all edges in the graph
            for(int j = 0; j < edges.length; j++)
            {
                // u is start, v is end, d is dist of edge u-v
                int u = edges[j][0];
                int v = edges[j][1];
                int d = edges[j][2];
                // The new distance uptill point v, with at most
                // i edges allowed would be the minimum of distance
                // so far with i-1 edges allowed, or the sum of length
                // of edge u-v and distcne of u by using atmost i-1
                // edges. This situation is same as the Knapsack where
                // we decide to whether or not incude an edge in the path.

                // If u is reachable from source
                if(dist[u] != Integer.MAX_VALUE)
                {
                    newDist[v] = Math.min(dist[v], dist[u] + d); 
                }
            }
            // Update the distance array for atmost i edges allowed
            dist = newDist;
        }
        System.out.println(dist[dest]);
    }
}
```
**<ins>For shortest path with exactly K edges</ins>:**<br>
The difference from the above approach would be that instead of carrying forward values from the previous iteration of k-1 edges, for the iteration for k edges allowed, we reinitialise the distance array everytime. This is done because we need necessarily the exact number of edges in our path and not less.
```java
public class Main

<a name="Backtracking"></a>
## <p align="center"> Recursion and Backtracking </p>
Backtracking is basically using recursion to solve problems that can have a divide and conquer approach applied to them. They key is that backtracking isn't just simple recursion but it is more of a trial and error recursion wherein solutions that fail are removed and those that work/pass are built further upon. For example, as we may see in a maze, that we might take certain routes which may not lead to the correct end point so we backtrack on that route to a certain point in time and then try a different route. We need not restart the entire process again and again.

Backtracking problems can generally be identified by words like
1. "Compute all/total .... where .... "
2. "Find all/total .... where .... "
3. "Generate all/total .... where .... "
4. "Print all/total .... where .... "
5. "Count all/total .... where .... "

that is, whenever the question demands you to exhaust all the possibilities under certain conditions, in almost all the cases a backtracking solution will exist. The solution might not garuantee the optimal answer, but will definitely exist with bcaktracking. 

<a name="R_BT_Keys"></a>
### Keys to backtracking
The three key concepts of backtracking are:
1. <ins>Choice</ins>: Decsisions to make, that is to make choices.
2. <ins>Constraints</ins>: Those choices are restricted on the basis of the question, and those conditions decide the validity of our choices.
3. <ins>Goal</ins>: Final target, maybe solve a maze, solve soduko, find minimum path or anything of this sort.

On the basis of these keys to backtracking, we can divide our process into steps as follows:
1. <ins>Identify, make and call a change</ins>:<br>What this basically means is that when we start with a decision base, we need to choose a decision to take and then change certain parameters wrt that decision.
2. <ins>Validate and/or recurse</ins>:<br>Once the decision has been taken, on the basis of the constraints provided by the question, we need to validate our decision. This validation can be on the basis of further recursive calls, or different 'if conditions' depending on the questions. Once validated, if needed, we recurse further to obtain an answer for this decision. In case due to the constrains of the question we believe that the path/choice chosen is invalid, we end the calls for that choice and go back to the step where we made that choice. Once we revert back to that step, we make a different choice if available, or return the expected answer in case of absence of new alternative choices.
3. <ins>Return/Undo the call</ins>:<br>The third key of backtracking as stated above is the goal. The goal is what helps us define the base conditions for our recursion function. If the call has reached the end state or the goal state then we return whatever value was expected to be returned at that state.

<a name="DynamicProgramming"></a>
## <p align="center"> Dynamic Programming </p>
Dynamic Programming solves complex problems that tend to take exponential time by dividing them into smaller subproblems and storing their results for use later on to calculate larger values.

<a name="DP_OverlappingSubproblems"></a>
### Overlapping Subproblems
Recursive solutions where the already calculated subproblems are called again and again result in exponential time complexities. Hence, if the solutions of the common subproblems are stored and used directly in O(1) time, the complexity of the entire problem is reduced by large. This is called the overlapping subproblems property of a dynamic programmign question.

One method to check the existence of this property is to generally find a recurrence relation that solves/fits the given question. A good point to note is that it is not necessary to solve the recurrence relation at hand but enough to just construct it. If the recurrence relation, calls the function itself forming a recurrence tree with common elements in different subtrees, then the overlapping subproblems property is satisfied. An example is fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2).

### Optimal Substructure
Optimal substructure property means that the results of the parents values should be directly computable from the optimal results of the child values. If this were not the case then even though the child values were available at hand, the parent values calculated would require recalculation from beginning to get the optimal answer for the parent. Hence, it is important to note that the recurrence relation/tree should not form any loopholes where the parent needs the value of the child and child needs the value of the parent for optimal answers.

<a name="DP_TabulationVsMemoization"></a>
### Tabulation vs Memoization
Tabulation is when you follow a bottom's up approach to solving the problems. For example if the recursion tree goes down to 15 levels so you start from the bottom, calculating subproblems to build to the final answer. You generally do this by having an array say dp[n] and start from filling dp[0] -> dp[1] -> -> dp[n] or dp[n] -> dp[n-1] -> - > dp[0], depending on the question format. Tabulation is used when it is necessary to solve all the possible subproblems for the final answer.

Memoization is a top down approach where you directly calculate for the final value but for every call you store the value of the subproblem such that if it is called again you can access the value directly. Generally values are stored in a hashmap and this technique is used when it is not necessary to solve all the subproblems for reaching the final answer.

### Solving a DP Problem
The DP question solving can be divided into further smaller tasks, just like DP: (LOL XD)
1. <ins>State identification</ins>: A state in a DP problem can be defined as something that helps you identify at which subproblem have you reached in your dp. For example it can be dp[index], where index is used to identify the the current subproblem, that is the current level can be traced using the index. In a knapsack problem this would be the [index][weight] and hence the dp formed is of the type dp[index][weight]. We need to identify the minimum number of variables needed to identify the states of a problem as it is these number of variables that help us construct our DP tables. One variable -> 1D array, 2 variables -> 2D array and so on.
2. <ins>Relations between states</ins>: Find the recursive relations which defines your states in terms of previously calculated values.
3. <ins>Choosing between tabulation and memoization</ins>: This choice should be made according to the differences explained in the previous section.

### DP with Backtracking (Top-down approach)
In certain situations we might need to solve a question with backtracking. Backtracking has been explained in detail in the section before(<a href="#Backtracking">Backtracking</a>). Backtracking enables us to explore all outcomes and choose the best afterwards when directly going for a particular outcome or greedy/iterative solutions won't work.

Using recursion we might encounter the same problem again and again making the time complexity of backtracking solutions exponential. Hence, we combine backtracking with DP, which in general cases is known as the top down recursive approach.

<a name="DP_2DimensionalGrids"></a>
### 2 Dimensional DP - Grids
The grid problems can be broadly classified into three subcategories:
1. Find minimum cost path in a given cost matrix.
2. Find number of ways to reach and ending point from the starting point.
3. Find number of ways to reach and ending point from the starting point with obstructions.<br>

All of these grid problems will have one common part, which is, movement will be allowed only in the right and down direction, enabling us to use DP, as the only two ways to reach a cell in the grid would be from the previously visited left and up cells. We will discuss these three variations one by one:

#### Finding Minimum-Cost Path in a 2-D Matrix
The problem statement is that given a cost matrix cost[][] where cost[i][j] is the cost of visiting the cell (i,j), find minimum cost path from (0,0) to (x,y). Only movements allowed are right and down.

The recurrence relation can be formed as: MinCost(i,j) = Math.min(MinCost(i-1,j), MinCost(i,j-1)) + cost[i][j]

The base conditions for this recurrence relation would be:
1. MinCost(0,0) = cost[0][0]
2. MinCost(0,j) = MinCost(0,j-1) + cost[0][j] (For cells in topmost row)
3. MinCost(i,0) = MinCost(i-1,0) + cost[i][0] (For cells in leftmost column)

As the problem requires every cell to be accounted for, that is all the cells that can be possibly visited need to be checked, tabulation method would work better than the topdown memoization approach. Start building from (0,0) and build to (i,j).

The minimum cost path problem can have several variants for calculating the maximum/minimum costs, sums, values to reach a given target. The standard format for solving such questions can be:
```java
// PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A CODE DEPICTION OF THE PROCESS,
// NOT THE PSEUDOCODE FOR THE CODE TO BE ACTUALLY WRITTEN

// Cost function:
// cost[i] = min/max(cost[of all j's just one step before i]) + cost[i]

// Build upto target cell from the beginning
for (int i = 1; i <= target; i++)
{
    // Let CellsToReachI be the array having number of ways to reach Ith cell
    // CellsToReachI is of the format [i-1, i-2, i-3 and so on]
    
    // So for every way to reach cell i
    for (int j = 0; j < CellsToReachI.size(); j++)
    {
        // If the question involves a validity constraint,
        // use an if to check if cell is valid
        if (CellsToReachI[j] <= i)
        {
            // Solve for the problem at hand
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[CellsToReachI[j]] + cost);
        }
    }
}
return dp[target]
```
<a href="#Contents">Back to contents</a>

#### Finding the number of ways to reach from a starting position to an ending position
You would be given a 2D matrix. The task is to find the number of ways to reach (i,j) from (0,0). Only movements allowed are right and down.

The recurrence relation can be formed as: NumWays(i,j) = NumWays(i-1,j) + NumWays(i,j-1)<br>

The base conditions for this recurrence relation would be:
1. NumWays(0,0) = 1
2. NumWays(0,j) = 1 (For cells in topmost row)
3. NumWays(i,0) = 1 (For cells in leftmost column)

As the problem requires every cell to be accounted for, that is all the cells that can be possibly visited need to be checked, tabulation method would work better than the topdown memoization approach. Start building from (0,0) and build to (i,j).

In case of obstacles(cells where you cannot go) being present, the input matrix has entries like 0 and 1. Every 0 cell is visitable and every 1 cell is blocked. Certain modifications to the above process would then be needed.

The recurrence relation would be modified to:<br>
NumWays(i,j) = NumWays(i-1,j) + NumWays(i,j-1), if (i,j) is unblocked<br>
NumWays(i,j) = 0, if (i,j) is blocked<br>

The base conditions for this recurrence relation would be:
1. NumWays(0,0) = 1(if unblocked) else 0
2. NumWays(0,j) = NumWays(0, j-1) (For cells in topmost row)
3. NumWays(i,0) = NumWays(i-1, 0) (For cells in leftmost column)

This type of enumeration problem might have several variations like counting number of ways to achieve a sum, counting number of ways to achieve a target or reach a destination and so on. The standard method to solve such kinds off problems is as follows:
```java
// PLEASE NOTE THIS IS A CODE DEPICTION OF THE PROCESS,
// NOT THE PSEUDOCODE FOR THE CODE TO BE ACTUALLY WRITTEN

// NumWay function:
// numWays[i] = numWays[i-1] + numWays[i-2] + .... + numWays[i-k]

// Build upto target cell from the beginning
for (int i = 1; i <= target; ++i)
{
    // Let CellsToReachI be the array having number of ways to reach Ith cell
    // CellsToReachI is of the format [i-1, i-2, i-3 and so on]
    
    // So for every way to reach cell i
    for (int j = 0; j < CellsToReachI.size(); ++j)
    {
        // If the question involves a validity constraint,
        // use an if to check if cell is valid
        
        // For this question the constraint is obstacles hence,
        // we check if cell does not have an obstacle
        if (input[i] == 0)
        {
            // Solve for the problem at hand
            dp[i] += dp[CellsToReachI[j]];
        }
    }
}
return dp[target]
```
***NOTE: THE DP APPROACH TO SOLVING GRID QUESTIONS WORKS ONLY WHEN THE ANSWER FOR A CELL IN THE DP TABLE CAN BE CALCULATED USING THE PRECOMPUTED VALUES. HENCE, EVEN A SMALL MODIFICATION SUCH AS ALLOWING MOVEMENTS IN ALL 4 DIRECTIONS WOULD REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR APPROACH TO PREFERABLY BFS(FOR MIN COST PATH) AND TO DFS/BACKTRACKING(FOR TOTAL PATHS/ CHECKING EXISTENCE OF A PATH).***

<a name="DP_MergeIntervals"></a>
### DP on Merging Intervals
Merging intervals DP questions will generally have a problem statement of the form, that, given a set of numbers find an optimal solution using the current number and the optimal values from the right and left sides.

The problem statement might not always be direct. It can be presented as a simple array with a target to achieve, or even a tree that requires merging of leaf nodes. The catch is that to achieve the target we should be able to identify that at every step some values of the array are merged together(that is used up to get a new value) and the size of the array reduces as we move ahead. So for example, let the operation be adding elements, our process might like this:<br>
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -> [1, 2, 3, 9] -> [3, 3, 9] -> [6, 9] -> [15]

The standard recurrence relation for such type of a problem would be:
```java
// dp[i][j] = Most optimal value of (dp[i][k] + result[k] + dp[k+1][j]) for k from i -> j
// i and j are the starting and ending index of the intervals
// The final answer hence would be dp[0][length of array - 1]
```
The standard method to code dp problems by merging up intervals looks like:
```java
/*
Decide the window size of the interval. We build from window size 1 to the
entire array length as our window size.
*/
for(int l = 1; l < n; l++)
{
    /*
    For the chosen window size, we need to traverse the entire array in
    chunks of that size. For example if window size is 3, in an array of
    length 5, we move like:
    [0,2] -> [1,3] -> [2,4] -> [3,5]
    Therefore, we need to decide starting and ending indexes.
    For the starting index, we move from 0 to (n - window size).
    */
    for(int i = 0; i < n-l; i++)
    {
        /*
        j becomes our ending index. This is always equal to i + l.
        j(ending index) = i(starting index) + l(window size)
        */
        int j = i+l;
        
        /*
        For every value k between our starting and ending index,
        we divide the interval into partitions [i -> k-1], [k], [k+1 -> j].
        The partition may also be divded as [i -> k][k+1 -> j].
        */
        /*
        The partitioning strategy depends on the question. What this means
        is that to decide what to do with the partitions and to decide where
        to make the partitions varries from question to question. In this
        example we assume we add the value from an array called doSomething[].
        */
        for(int k = i; k < j; k++)
        {
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + doSomething[k] + dp[k+1][j]);
        }
    }
}
// Return the value for entire range of the array as one window
return dp[0][n-1]
```

### DP on Strings
The general problem statement is that given two string or maybe one string, return some result. The result can be to find existence or value of some subsequence or substring according to a condition or to find the count of certain possible subsequences/substrings.

The common pattern followed for two string questions is:
```java
/*
The two strings are arranged in a character by character matrix s1 x s2.
i is for String 1
j is for String 2
We move ahead by comparing the two string character by character.
*/

// For every character in String 1
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
{
    // For every character in String 2
    for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++)
    {
        if (s1[i-1] == s2[j-1])
        {
            dp[i][j] = /*Implement required function here*/;
        }
        else
        {
            dp[i][j] = /*Implement required function here*/;
        }
    }
}
```
The common pattern followed for a single string questions is:
```java
/*
The same string is arraned in the s1 x s1 matrix. The approach now
is to check the required conditions/validations for every
subsequence/substring of the string. To check for every substring,
we move the end point of our substring from 1 -> length of string,
and consider every starting point possible for each end point. Hence,
the substrings for string "abcde" in each iteration would look like:
For end point a: a
For end point b: a->b, b
For end point c: a->c, b->c, c
For end point d: a->d, b->d, c->d, d
For end point e: a->e, b->e, c->e, d->e, e
*/

// We begin by choosing the end point
// Ranges from 1 to size of string.
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
{
    // Choose the starting point for the substring
    // Ranges from 0 to (end point - 1)
    for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++)
    {
        if (s[i] == s[j])
        {
            dp[i][j] = /*Implement required function here*/;
        }
        else
        {
            dp[i][j] = /*Implement required function here*/;
        }
    }
}
```

<a name="DP_Decision"></a>
### DP for decision making - Knapsack
The general problem statement for such type of problems is to decide the most optimal option from a given set. The task is to make an optimal choice from a given set at every instance or maybe just once.

The standard approach is that given a choice, we have two options, to either make that choice or to ignore it.
1. If we make that choice, we calculate the best between the current option and the previous time where we ignored the given choice
2. If we choose to ignore the choice now, we just choose the value from the previous time we made the choice.

The Knapsack problem is a very famous and standard example of a DP consisting of decision choices of including or including an option in the answer set. The standard problem statement of Knapsack problems is:<br>
Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

The Knapsack problem can be divided into the following three categories parts:
1. 0-1 Knapsack Problem: Each item can be selected at most once.
2. Unbounded Knapsack Problem: Each item can be selected infinite number of times.
3. Bounded Knapsack Problem: We can select at most K items.

#### <ins>0-1 Knapsack Problem</ins>:
We are given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value we can make by choosing items such that sum of the weights of these items is smaller than or equal to W. We can only pick an item at most once, hence the name, 0-1 knapsack that is either pick or not pick.

A simple straightforward solution can be:
1. Generate all subsets of items.
2. Select subsets with total weight <= W.
3. Select the highest value subset.<br>

We can improvise on the above approach while creating the subsets. Insteax of creating all subsets and then moving on to selecting those with weight less than equal to W, we can rather build only those that satisfy this condition. While building a subset for every item we can have only two choices, that is to pick or not pick the item. Let us say for choosing the nth item in a subset:
1. <ins>Do not pick the item</ins>: If the weight of the nth item + weight so far > W, then we cannot pick the item and this is the only viable choice. The maximum value obtained will eb the value of n-1 items picked so far. The weight so far remains unchanged.
2. <ins>Pick the item</ins>: If the weight of the nth item + weight so far <= W, then we have an option to pick this item. The value obtained will be value of nth item plus value obtained by n-1 items and the weight so far will also increase by the weight of the nth item.

The following recursive approach can be developed using the above points:
```java
// RECURSIVE APPROACH FOR 0-1 KNAPSACK
// W - Weight allowed
// n - Number of items remaining to check
// wt[] and val[] are weight and value arrays
public static int knapSack(int W, int wt[], int val[], int n) 
{
    // If all items have ben checked or remaining weight is 0
    if (n == 0 || W == 0)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // If weight of the nth item is more than Knapsack capacity W,
    // then this item cannot be included in the optimal solution
    if (wt[n - 1] > W)
    {
        // Move to the next item without selecting this item
        // Hecne the remaining weight remaing unchanged
        return knapSack(W, wt, val, n - 1);
    }

    // If weight of the nth item is not more than Knapsack capacity W,
    // then this item can be included in the knapasck and hence we
    // return the maximum of two cases where we iether select or not
    // select the item
    else
    {
        // If the item is selected, remaining weight is reduced by item's weight that is
        // wt[n-1] and current value is increased by the item's value that is val[n-1]

        // If the item is not selected no increase in value and no change in weight. Similar
        // to the above case of not selecting an item due to ineligibility
        return Math.max(val[n - 1] + knapSack(W - wt[n - 1], wt, val, n - 1), knapSack(W, wt, val, n - 1));
    }
}
```
In the recursive approach, it can be noted, that the same subproblem will be called repeatedly and hence a more efficient, preferable dynamic programming approach which helps us store the values of repeated subproblems would be preferred.

We build the DP through the following steps:
1. Build a DP table int[Number of items allowed + 1][Maximum weight allowed + 1]. The cell dp[i][j] would hold the maximum value that cen be obtained from considering items from 1 -> i, with the maximum weight allowed as j. All values in dp[0][j] = 0 as with zero items considered, no value is possible. Similarly, all values in dp[i][0] = 0, as with no weight allowed, no value is possible.
2. The rule for fillign the DP is similar to the recursive approach, that is, we first check whether or not an items is eligible to be used at the given moment. If eligible we choose the maximum between the twop options of using or not using that item, and if not eligible, we just move ahead to the next item without changing the value obtained so far.
3. To process the DP table in a bottoms up manner, so that we can readily have previously calculated values available, we build the tables in the following manner:
```
For every item i (0 -> i):
    For every weight possible j (0 -> W):
        If not eligible for weight j:
            // Previous value without this item
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
        If item i is eligible for weight j:
            // Max of choosing the item and not choosing
            dp[i][j] = MaxOf(val[i] + dp[i-1][j-wt[i]], dp[i-1][j]);
```
4. Finally return the value for dp[Total number of Items][Maxium weight allowed].

The enitre code is as follows:
```java
public static int knapSack(int W, int wt[], int val[], int n) 
{
    int dp[][] = new int[n + 1][W + 1];
    for (i = 0; i <= n; i++)
    {
        for (j = 0; j <= W; j++)
        { 
            if (i == 0 || j == 0)
            {
                dp[i][j] = 0;
                continue;
            }
            if (wt[i - 1] <= j)
            {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(val[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][j - wt[i - 1]], dp[i - 1][j]);
            }
            else
            {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[n][W];
}
```
#### <ins>Unbounded Knapsack Problem</ins>:
Given a knapsack weight W and a set of n items with certain value vali and weight wti, we need to calculate minimum amount that could make up this quantity exactly. This is different from classical Knapsack problem, as here we are allowed to use unlimited number of instances of an item.

With the allowance of using an item as many times as we wish, the only thing that needs to be monitored now is the weight cap. Hence, instead of the 2D DP table, a 1D table of the form int[Maximum weight allowed + 1] can be created to keep track of the maximum value obtained for a given weight. Every item dp[i] would be the maximum value with upto i weight allowed. Hence, the process would now look like:
```java
public static int knapSack(int W, int wt[], int val[], int n) 
{
    // DP array for weight
    int dp[] = new int[W + 1];
    // For every item
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        // For all weights, it can fit
        for (j = wt[i]; j <= W; j++)
        {
            // Choose between using or not using that item
            dp[j] = Math.max(val[i] + dp[j - wt[i], dp[j]);
        }
    }
    // Return value for maximum weight allowed
    return dp[W];
}
```
#### <ins>Extended Knapsack Problem</ins>:
Given N items, each item having a given weight and value, the task is to maximize the value by selecting a maximum of K items adding up to a maximum weight W. This is a step ahead of the 0-1 Knapsack problem, where besides a cap on an item being selected atmost once, we also have a cap on total items being selected to be <= to K.

The modification to a normal 0-1 Knapsack DP would be that insetad of a 2D table, we now use a 3D tables which look like dp[Total number of items + 1][Maximum weight allowed + 1][Number of items allowed + 1]. And every cell dp[i][j][k] would hold the maximum value possible by using items upto item i, with maximum weight allowed as j and maximum total items allowed as k.

The recursive formula would remain the same and look as follows:
```
For every item i (0 -> i):
    For every weight possible j (0 -> W):
        For number of items allowed k (0 -> K):
            If i = 0 or j = 0; or k = 0:
                dp[i][j][k] = 0
            If not eligible for weight j:
                // Previous value without this item
                dp[i][j][k] = dp[i-1][j][k]
            If item i is eligible for weight j:
                // Max of choosing the item and not choosing 
                dp[i][j][k] = MaxOf(val[i] + dp[i-1][j-wt[i]][k-1], dp[i-1][j][k]);
```
The final code would look like:
```java
public static int boundedKnapsack(int val[], int wt[], int N, int W, int K)
{
    // i = 0; j = 0; k = 0 are not needed to be considered
    for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
    {
        for (int j = 1; j <= W; j++)
        {
            for (int k = 1; k <= K; k++)
            {
                // If eligibale
                if (j >= weight[i])
                {
                    // Max of selecting or not selecting
                    // If selected so:
                    // Weight becomes weight - wt[i]
                    // Item goes back to i-1
                    // Number of allowed items is reduced by 1
                    dp[i][j][k] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j][k], dp[i - 1][j - wt[i]][k - 1] + val[i]);
                }

### Longest Integer Subsequence(LIS)
The longest integer subsequence problem requires you to find the length of the longest increasing integer subsequence in an array. For example for the array [5, 8, 3, 7, 9, 1] the answer would be 3 and the subsequence would be [3, 7, 9]. Do note, the subsequence is not necessarily contiguous.

For every index, we store the length of the LIS upto that point such that the given element at the index is also included. We store this in an array of the form dp[n+1]. The final answer would be the maximum of all dp[i]. dp[i] is calculated by getting the max LIS of all elements upto the current index such that their ending element is smaller than the current element. The code is as follows:
```java
// dp[i] = 1 + Max(All dp[j] such that j < i and arr[j] is smaller than arr[i]).

class Solution
{
    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums)
    {
        int n = nums.length;
        // If n < 2, then no subsequence to choose from
        if(n == 0 || n == 1)
        {
            return n;
        }
        // DP Table
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        // Subsequence of single element is always increasing
        dp[0] = 1;
        // Current answer is 1
        int ans = 1;
        // For all elements after index 0
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        {
            // Minimum length of subsequence at any index will
            // be 1, as the element in itself will always form
            // an increasing subsequence
            dp[i] = 1;
            // For all elements before index i
            for(int j = 0; j < i; j++)
            {
                // If element at index j is smaller than element
                // at index i, then it can form a valid subsequence
                if(nums[j] < nums[i])
                {
                    // New value is max of prev and current possible
                    // Current possible = Length till j + 1
                    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
                // Ans is ax of all subsequences
                ans = Math.max(dp[i], ans);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
The problem may have two variations as follows:
1. Longest decreasing subsequence: Simply change the comparison of getting values lesser than the current element so far to getting values greater than the current element so far.
2. Longest increasing followed by decreasing subsequence: Calculate LIS from the beginning and also LIS from the end. The LIS from the end acts as a decreasing subsequence of elements ahead in the list. For example, LIS from the back would mean that for dp[i] the value is the longest decreasing subsequence from i -> n instead of from 0 -> i. Then calculate the max of (FrontLIS + BackLIS for all i).

### Unique Paths in a grid with obstacles
The question requires us to move from the top left to bottom down in a grid, with only movements allowed in right and down directions. We have to find the total number of unique paths to do so. The grid also contains obstacles which are marked as 1 and the free spaces are marked as 0.

The number of ways to reach a cell will always be equal to the number of ways to reach the cell above it + the number of ways to reach the cell to the left. Hence, we can create a 2D DP table, where every cell dp[i][j] holds the number of ways to reach (i,j), and to calculate dp[i][j] we use the following relation:<br>
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j](Number of ways to reach above cell) + dp[i][j-1](Number of ways to reach left cell)<br>
The final snwer would be dp[n][m], if there are n rows and m columns, that is the number of ways to reach last cell.

Moreover, as we have obstacles, if a cell contains an obstacle the number of ways to reach it would be 0. Hence, if either the starting or ending cell have an obstacle, total unique ways will be 0.
```java
class Solution
{
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid)
    {
        int n = obstacleGrid.length;
        if(n == 0)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        int m = obstacleGrid[0].length;
        if(m == 0)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        /*
        Need dp[][] of size [n+1][m+1] because for the top row and
        the first column of the grid, the values needed would not be
        available and hence to avoid writing extra if conditions and
        for avoiding null pointer exception, we increase the size by
        1 on both sides. Now, when dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1] are
        accessed for the top row and first column, only 0 values will
        received.
        */
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][m+1];
        // If starting point or ending point themselves are blocked
        if(obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1 || obstacleGrid[n-1][m-1] == 1)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        // First cell has only way to reach and forms our base case
        dp[1][1] = 1;
        // For every row
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        {
            // For every column
            for(int j = 1; j <= m; j++)
            {
                // If cell is reachables
                if(obstacleGrid[i-1][j-1] != 1)
                {
                    // Number of ways = Number of ways to reach left cell
                    //                  + Number of ways to reach top cell 
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1];
                }
            }
        }
        // Return number of ways to reach last cell
        return dp[n][m];
    }
}
```

### Minimum sum path in a grid
The problem statement is as follows:<br>
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

The minimum cost path to any cell in the grid will be the minimum of the cell above and the cell to the left of the current cell. This is because the only two valid ways to reach the current cell are from top or from left as movements allowed are only right and bottom. Hence, the cost of any cell would be:<br>
Cost to reach cell (i,j) = Cost of cell (i,j) + Minimum(Cost to reach (i-1,j), Cost to reach (i,j-1))

The code is as follows:
```java
class Solution
{
    public int minPathSum(int[][] grid)
    {
        int n = grid.length;
        if(n == 0)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        int m = grid[0].length;
        if(m == 0)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        int[][] dp = new int[n][m];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 0; j < m; j++)
            {
                // As we take minimum of top and left, and cells in top row
                // can be reached only from the left, we consider only left
                // value
                if(i == 0)
                {
                    if(j == 0)
                    {
                        dp[i][j] = grid[i][j];
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + grid[i][j];    
                    }
                }
                // As we take minimum of top and left, and cells in left col
                // can be reached only from the top, we consider only the top
                // value
                else if(j == 0)
                {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + grid[i][j];
                }
                // Cell can be reached from both sides, hence consider both values
                else
                {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]) + grid[i][j];

### Longest Common Subsequence
The longest common subsequence problem requires you to find the length of the longest common subsequence between two given strings. For example for the inputs 'ABCDGH' and 'AEDFHR', the length would be 3, and the longest common subsequence would be 'ADH'.

As seen for string DP above, we store the two strings in character arrays say s1arr and s2arr and then make a dp table of the form dp[n+1][m+1]. The entry dp[i][j] would hold the value of the longest common subsequence between the strings s1[0..1] and s2[0..j]. We compare the two input string character by character. If the ith and jth characters in the strings are equal, then the length of LCS increases by 1, as we have got one extra common character. Hence,<br>
dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]

If the ith and jth characters in the strings are not equal, then the length of LCS does not increase and remains the same as the previous maximum value. The previous maximum value will either be the maximum length LCS when character from string 1 is not included or when character from string 2 is not included. Hence,<br>
dp[i][j] = Maximum Of (dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j])

The code is as follows:
```java
class Solution
{
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2)
    {
        int n = text1.length();
        int m = text2.length();
        // Convert string to charArrays for easier character access
        char[] s1 = text1.toCharArray();
        char[] s2 = text2.toCharArray();
        // dp[i][j] represents length of longest subequence between
        // text1[0:i] and text2[0:j].
        
        // DP is of greater size to account for previous values of
        // top row and first column
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][m+1];
        // The value of i represents that text1 is from
        // 1st to i'th character
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        {
            // The value of j represents that text2 is from
            // 1st to j'th character
            for(int j = 1; j <= m; j++)
            {
                // Remeber that charArray indexing is from 0

                // If the two characters are equal
                if(s1[i-1] == s2[j-1])
                {
                    // dp[i][j] = Longest subsequence without these characters + 1
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
                }
                // If the characters are not equal
                else
                {
                    // dp[i][j] = Longest subsequence when either of the characters
                    // is removed
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][m];
    }

### Longest Common Substring/Subarray
The problem statement is that given two integer arrays A and B, return the maximum length of an subarray that appears in both arrays. This can also be presented as to find the maximum length of common substring between two strings s1 and s2.

This is very similar to the previous question of finding the longest subsequence but instead of subsequence we have to find a substring. As we need to calculate the substring, one thing which we need to be sure about is that we have to ensure that a valid answer is one in which there were no gaps between the characters of the candidate answer. For example, for the strings:<br>
String A: 'ABCDEFGH'<br>
String B: 'BCADFIH'<br>
If the question was to find longest common subsequence the answer would have been 'BCDFH', but as we need the substring, the answer is 'BC'.

Instead of string, we solve this question on subarrays two given subarrays A and B. For example if:<br>
A: [1,2,3,2,]<br>
B: [3,2,1,4,7]<br>
Then the asner would be 3 as the longest common subarray is [3, 2, 1].

We create a dp table, dp[Length of A][Length of B] where dp[i][j] represents length of the longest common subarray between A[0:i] and B[0:j] with A[i] and B[j] necessarily being included in the subarray. We compare the two subarrays index by index, and if we find a common value, we check the length of the longest common subarray until the point these indexes were not included and add 1 to it. Hence,<br>
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;

If the values in the two subarrays do not match, unlike longest common subsequence, we do nothing. This is because as we need a contigous subarray, two values tht are not equal would form a ap in the subarray, making it a subsequence and hence are disregarded. The code is as follows:
```java
class Solution
{
    public int findLength(int[] A, int[] B)
    {
        int n = A.length;
        int m = B.length;
        // dp[i][j] represents length of longest subarray between
        // A[0:i] and B[0:j] including the characters A[i-1] and B[j-1].
        
        // DP is of greater size to account for previous values of
        // top row and first column
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][m+1];
        
        // We tore the maximum length of substring in ans, as the final cell,
        // dp[n][m] will not necessarily have the longest subarray of entire
        // array but only the longest subarray which includes A[n-1] and A[m-1].
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        {
            for(int j = 1; j <= m; j++)
            {
                // If the two values are equal, then this can be a part of
                // previous longest subarray
                if(A[i-1] == B[j-1])
                {
                    // dp[i][j] = 1 + Longest subarray jsut before this
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
                    // Maximum subarray so far
                    ans = Math.max(ans, dp[i][j]);
                }
                // There is no else condition, as we need a contigous
                // subarray, hence if the two values are not equal then
                // that means there is a gap in the subarray and hence
                // the value of longest common subarray when A[i-1] != B[j-1]
                // is 0, which is the default value of dp[i][j].
            }
        }
        // Return maximum length
        return ans;
    }
}

### Longest Palindromic Subsequence
Given a string s, we have to find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

First let us understand how a plaindrome can be identified. One straightforawrd method would be to compare the starting and ending characters one by one and check if they are equal and move to the middle like this. If every pair was equal then the string is a palindrome else it is not. This same process can be reversed as well, that is we begin from the middle and move to the end, we can check for mathcing characters at both ends. This idea can be utilized in building a DP based colution for the problem at hand.

For a given substring, we can form a recurrence relation that if the starting and ending characters are equal then length of longest plaindrome for that substring would be equal to 2 + length of longest palindrome in substring formed by removing the first and last character. We may visualize this as follows:<br>
String A: 'ABA'<br>
String A is a palindrome of length 3. Now say if we have another string as follows:<br>
String B: 'CABAC'<br>
We need not check the entire string B for being a palindrome instead we just check the first and last chaacter which are equal, and we already know that for ABA length of palindrome is 3, hence length for CABAC becomes 2 + 3 = 5.<br>
Moreover for Strings of length upto 3, that is strings of kind 'A', 'AA', 'AXA', if the first and last character are equal we can directly say that the length of the substring is the length of the palindrome.<br>
We utilize these concepts to build our dp solution.

We create a DP table dp[Length of S][Length of S] where dp[i][j] represents the length of the longest palindromic substring in String s[j:i] that is the substring which begins at j and ends at i, both j and i included. Now to solve the DP, we follow the steps discussed in <a href="#DP_Strings">DP for Strings</a> for a single string question.

If the characters at the beginning and end of the given subsequence say S[j:i] are equal, we simply update length for S[j:i] as length for S[j+1:i-1] + 2.<br>
dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j+1] + 2<

If the characters are not equal then length of longest palindromic subsequence in S[j:i] would be maximum of length in S[j+1:i] or S[j:i-1].<br>
dp[i][j] = Max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j+1])

The code is as follows:
```java
class Solution
{
    public int longestPalindromeSubseq(String s)
    {
        int n = s.length();
        // In our dp table every state is repreented as:
        // dp[i][j] = Longest palindromic subsequence from s[j:i]
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        char[] s1 = s.toCharArray();
        
		// The ending character of the subsequence is marked by i
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            // j marks the starting character of the subsequence

            // The reason we cannot start j from 0 and then move to i
            // is that to find the value of s[j:i] we need the value of
            // s[j+1:i-1] already calculated. Hence, for j, the value 
            // already needed is of the cell j+1 instead of j-1.

            // Hence, i increases from 0 -> n and j decreases from i -> 0.
            for(int j = i; j >= 0; j--)
            {
                // If the two characters are equal, meaning the end and start are
                // equal, so all we need to check is that whether or not the string
                // inside is a plaindrome
                if(s1[i] == s1[j])
                {
                    // If length of subsequence <= 3, we need not check for plaindrome
                    // wihtin the string as it will guaranteed be a palindrome
                    if(i - j < 3)
                    {
                        dp[i][j] = i - j + 1;
                    }
                    
					// If length is more than 3, the new length of longest palindromic
                    // subsequence will be:
                    //For string s[j:i] = 1(for starting character)
                    //                  + 1(for ending character)
                    //                  + Length of longest palindrome for s[j+1:i-1]
                    else
                    {
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j+1] + 2;
                    }
                }
                
				// If starting and ending characters are not equal, then length is same
                // as maximum possible length if either the starting or ending character

                }
            }
        }
        // Return length with ending as n-1 and starting as 0, that is entire string as subsequence

### Longest Palindromic Substring/Subarray
The problem statement is exactly same as the previous one with the only difference being that instead of subsequence now we need a substring. The modifications from the previous approach would be:
1. dp[i][j] now doesnt represent longest palindromic subsequence but instead represents the longest palindromic substring necessarily including the i'th and j'th characters of the string. Hence, the value for dp would not either be 0 or the length of entire substring.
2. If the characters at start and end do not match, we discard that substring as if we considered it, it would have created gaps in the answer leading to subsquence formation.
3. We also need an additional check even if characters in end and start match, that is we need to make sure that the substring contained within was a palindrome. This can be simply done by checking if dp[i-1][j+1] != 0.

The code is as follows:
```java
class Solution
{
    public String longestPalindrome(String s)
    {
        int n = s.length();
        if(n < 2)
        {
            return s;
        }
        char[] s1 = s.toCharArray();
        // In our dp table every state is repreented as:
        // dp[i][j] = Longest palindromic substring from s[j:i],
        // such that s[j] and s[i] are necessarily a part of the
        // substring. We need to ensure this, because the question
        // asks us to find contigous substrings instead of subsequence
        // hence no breaks are allowed between characters
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        // Initial length of palindromic substring
        int ans = 0;
        // Start and end values for storing the starting and ending of the
        // palindromic substring
        int start = -1;
        int end = -1;
        // i marks the ending character of the substring
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            // j marks the starting character of the substring
            
            // The reason we cannot start j from 0 and then move to i
            // is that to find the value of s[j:i] we need the value of
            // s[j+1:i-1] already calculated. Hence, for j, the value 
            // already needed is of the cell j+1 instead of j-1.
            
            // Hence, i increases from 0 -> n and j decreases from i -> 0.
            for(int j = i; j >= 0; j--)
            {
                // If the two characters are equal, meaning the end and start are
                // equal, so all we need to check is that whether or not the string
                // inside is a plaindrome
                if(s1[i] == s1[j])
                {
                    // If length of substring <= 3, we need not check for plaindrome
                    // wihtin the string as it will garaunteed be a palindrome
                    if(i - j < 3)
                    {
                        dp[i][j] = i - j + 1;
                    }
                    // If length is more than 3 and the substring contained is also a
                    // a plaindrome, then the new length of the longest palindromic
                    // substring will be:
                    //For string s[j:i] = 1(for starting character)
                    //                  + 1(for ending character)
                    //                  + Length of longest palindrome for s[j+1:i-1]
                    else if(dp[i-1][j+1] != 0)
                    {
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j+1] + 2;
                    }
                }
                // There is no else condition as we are searching for contigous substrings,
                // and hence if the starting and ending characters are not equal, these cannot
                // be included in forming the palindromic substring, thus the length will be
                // 0, which is the default value of dp[i][j].
                
                // Select the maximum length palindromic substring
                if(dp[i][j] > ans)
                {
                    ans = dp[i][j];

                    // Ending point is marked as i + 1 because of the substring function at the end
                    end = i + 1;
                }

### Maximum Sum Subarray
The question is that given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum. This is the same as Kedane's algorithm but rather with a DP approach. Please visit <a href="#Arrays_KadanesAlgo">Kadane's Algorithm</a> in Arrray section first and then revisit this problem. The commented code is as below: 
```java
class Solution
{
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums)
    {
        int n = nums.length;
        int ans = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        if(n == 0)
        {
            return ans;
        }
        // dp[i] would represent maximum sum possible if for nums[0:i]
        // with nums[i] included in the subarray
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        // Max sum possible for first element is element itself
        dp[0] = nums[0];
        ans = dp[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
        {
            // Sum of current value and max sum so far till previous element
            int val = nums[i] + dp[i-1];
            // As previous sum was till the point including the previous element,
            // so if this new sum > value of current index so we have a new max
            // sum contigous subarray
            if(val > nums[i])
            {
                dp[i] = val;
            }
            // If new sum <= current value, so max including current value until now
            // is the current value itself
            else
            {
                dp[i] = nums[i];
            }
            // Answer is the maximum subarray sum so far
            ans = Math.max(ans, dp[i]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

### Maximum Sum Subarray without adjacent elements
A slight modification of the previous question. Given a 2 x N grid of integer, A, choose numbers such that the sum of the numbers is maximum and no two chosen numbers are adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally, and return it. For exmaple if the input is of the form:<br>
[[1, 2, 3, 4]<br>
[2, 3, 4, 5]]<br>
In here we would choose the numbers 3 and 5 to form the maximum sum wihtout adjacent elements.

We create a dp table of the form int[Number of rows + 2][Number of columns + 2]. We add 2 to both as while checking, we would need to check the following:
1. Rows just above and below the current value, hence, for topmost row we need a new row above and for bottom most row we need an extra row below.
2. We will be accessing column 2 before the current value to check for previous values, hence for the first leftmost column we need two new columns on the left.

At every value we simply take the max among the following:
1. If we include the element: Current Value + Maximum between non adjacent values from two columns before, that is MaxOf(dp[i-1][j-2], dp[i][j-2], dp[i+1][j-2]).
2. If we do not include the element: Maximum between the adjacent values from current and previous column, that is MaxOf(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i][j-1], dp[i+1][j-1], dp[i+1][j]).

The code is as follows:
```java
public class Solution
{
    public int adjacent(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> A)
    {
        // Number of rows
        int n = 2;
        // Number of columns
        int m = A.get(0).size();
        // Number of rows + 2 because we need one row above and one below
        // when accounting for adjacent element above and below
        
        // Number of columns + 2 because we need to access values from 2
        // columns before in case of we are going to skip the previous column's
        // values
        int[][] dp = new int[n+2][m+2];
        // For every column
        for(int j = 2; j < m+2; j++)
        {
            // For every row
            for(int i = 1; i < n+1; i++)
            {
                // a is the max if we do not include current element
                int a = Math.max(dp[i+1][j], Math.max(dp[i+1][j-1], Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])));
                // b is the max if we include the current element
                int b = A.get(i-1).get(j-2) + Math.max(dp[i+1][j-2], Math.max(dp[i][j-2], dp[i-1][j-2]));
                // dp[i][j] = Max of either including or not including the current element
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(a, b);
            }
        }
        // Return value at nth row, and mth column
        return dp[n][m+1];
    }
}
```

### Buy and Sell Stock - K transactions allowed
The question is similar to Buy and Sell Stock I and II as covered in Arrays. The difference being that we are allowed at most 2 transactions. We generalise the concept for atmost k transactions. The question statement is as follows:<br>
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions. You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

The code can be solved using the knapsack strategy of deciding to whether or not to sell the stock on a given day. The code has been explained in the comments itself:
```java
class Solution
{
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices)
    {
        int n = prices.length;
        // If only one or zero price points, then no transactions
        if(n <= 1)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        // Maximum number of transactions allowed
        int k = 2;
        // Current profit
        int ans = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        // dp[i][j] denotes profit by doing 'i' trnsactions until
        // day j. We can only sell on the j'th day and not buy.
        // So technically we assume that 'i' buyings and 'i-1' times
        // selling has been done until day j.
        // dp[0, n] = 0 as 0 times transation makes 0 profit
        // dp[k, 0] = 0 as we cannot sell on day 0
        int[][] dp = new int[k+1][n];
        
        // For every transaction t
        for(int t = 1; t <= k; t++)
        {
            // temp denotes the profit so far - buying cost of latest stock
            // The profit so far at any day d would be:
            // Profit from previous t-1 transactions. Let us assume the day
            // of buying the t'th stock is d, hence, profit so far = dp[t-1][d]
            // Buying cost at day d: prices[d]
            // Hence temp = dp[t-1][d] - prices[d]

            // temp begins from day 0
            // As we can only buy on day 0 and the profit so far is 0.
            int temp = -prices[0];
            
            // Our task is to maximize profit for the t'th transaction on every day.            
            // For all selling days possible
            for(int d = 1; d < n; d++)
            {
                // On any given day 'd', the maximum profit at that day is:
                // Either profit from completing t transactions before this day itself.
                // That is we do not sell any stock on the given day. This is dp[t-1][d].

                // Or by selling a stock on the given day 'd', hence:
                // For all possible buying days we calculate max Of:
                //       Selling price of stock on the given day 'd'
                //     - Buying cost of stock on a previous day before 'd'
                //     + Profit with one less transaction on the buying day selected
                // which is = Selling price + MaxOf(Profit - BuyPrice) for all buying days
                // For selling on day 'd' this would be:
                // = MaxOf(prices[d] - prices[j] + dp[t-1, j]) For all j in range of [0, d-1]
                // = prices[d] + MaxOf(dp[t-1, j] - prices[j]) For all j in range of [0, d-1]

                // Instead of calculatig MaxOf(dp[t-1, j] - prices[j]) seperately for every day,
                // it is calculated simultanesouly through the variable temp as we progress
                // through each day. This can be done because for MaxOf(dp[t-1, j] - prices[j])
                // till a given day d, all we need is the previous value of temp till day d-1,
                // the previously calculated value of dp[t-1][d] and prices[d]

                dp[t][d] = Math.max(dp[t][d-1], prices[d] + temp);
                temp = Math.max(temp, dp[t-1][d] - prices[d]);
                
                // Update profit
                ans = Math.max(ans, dp[t][d]);
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
