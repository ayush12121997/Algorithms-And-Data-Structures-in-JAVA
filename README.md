## Algorithms-And-Data-Structures-in-JAVA

I have tried to cover the majority of important coding algorithms and data structures from a technical interview point of view.
The codes/topics/algos covered in this repo might not be up to date and are definitely not exhaustive.
I will try to keep updating the repository as and when time permist.

I have kept the repository public as my goal is to create a question bank to help others preparing for coding interview.

It is a request to users, to not copy paste the content of the repository as their own, and provide due credits wherever necessary.
