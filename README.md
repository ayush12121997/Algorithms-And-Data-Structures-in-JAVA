## Algorithms And Data Structures in JAVA

I have tried to cover majority of the important coding algorithms and data structures from a technical interview point of view in this repository. The codes/topics/algos covered might not be up to date and are definitely not exhaustive. I will try to keep updating the repository as and when time permits. The updated parts would be accessible through the links in the contents, and the parts planned to be added are visible as plain text in the contents table.

Completng the list of questions and topics in this repository does not gaurantee selection in the interview, but surely will make you better prepared for it.

In case of suggested modification, or topics someone would like to suggest that should be covered, please mail to:<br>
ayush.academics.1212@gmail.com<br>
ayush16024@iiitd.ac.in

I have kept the repository public as my goal is to create a question bank to help others preparing for coding interview. It is a request to users, to not copy paste the content of the repository as their own, and provide due credits wherever necessary.

All the best for your preparation!
