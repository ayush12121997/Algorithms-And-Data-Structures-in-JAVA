## Algorithms and Data Structures in JAVA

Hey,
I have tried to cover majority of the important coding algorithms and data structures from a technical interview point of view in this repository. I will try to keep updating the repository as and when time permits. The up to date parts would be accessible through the links in the contents, and the parts planned to be added are visible as plain text in the contents table.

The codes/topics/algos covered might not be up to date and are definitely not exhaustive, given the vast pool of questions available out there. I have simply made an attempt at gathering and explaining those which I feel important from a coding interview perspective. Completing the list of questions and topics in this repository does not gaurantee selection in any interview, but surely will make you better prepared for it. The content has been divided into their respective subtopics, and an attempt has been made to cover the topics from basic to advanced under each heading. 

I have kept the repository public as my goal is to create a question bank to help those who are practicing/revising data structures and algorithms for a coding interview. It is a request to users, to not copy paste the content of the repository as their own, and provide due credits wherever necessary. Moreover, I do not take credits for devising the algorithms and concepts covered in this repository. The repository is just an explanation of my understanding and implementation of the topics covered.

In case of suggestions to modify topics/questions or add new ones, please mail to:<br>

All the best for your preparation!
