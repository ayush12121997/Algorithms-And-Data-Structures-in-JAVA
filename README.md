## Algorithms And Data Structures in JAVA

I have tried to cover the majority of important coding algorithms and data structures from a technical interview point of view.
The codes/topics/algos covered in this repo might not be up to date and are definitely not exhaustive.
I will try to keep updating the repository as and when time permist.

I have kept the repository public as my goal is to create a question bank to help others preparing for coding interview.

Completng the list of questions and topics in this repository does not gaurantee selection in the interview, but surely will make you better prepared for it.

It is a request to users, to not copy paste the content of the repository as their own, and provide due credits wherever necessary.
